<br /><i>The House of Mystery</i></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Be quiet, Silky! What&rsquo;s the matter with you?
You don&rsquo;t usually bark like common dogs over
nothing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The brown spaniel stopped under a maple
tree and wagged his tail forlornly, looking
pleadingly into his mistress&rsquo;s eyes, as if he were
trying to tell her that he wasn&rsquo;t just making a
fuss over nothing.</p>
<p>Mary Louise Gay stooped over and patted his
head. She was a pretty girl of sixteen, with dark
hair and lovely brown eyes and long lashes that
would make an actress envious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see what Silky means!&rdquo; cried her companion,
Jane Patterson who lived next door to
Mary Louise and was her inseparable chum.
&ldquo;Look, Mary Lou! Up in the tree. A kitten!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both girls gazed up at the leafy branches
overhead and spied a tiny black kitten crying
piteously. It had climbed up and couldn&rsquo;t get
down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get it,&rdquo; said Mary Louise.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">[12]</div>
<p>She swung herself lightly to the lowest
branch, chinned herself, and climbed the tree.
In another minute she had rescued the kitten
with her hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stretch on your tiptoes, Jane,&rdquo; she called to
her chum, &ldquo;and see if I can hand it down to
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other girl, who was much shorter and
stockier than Mary Louise, did as she was told,
but the distance was too great.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose I&rsquo;ll have to climb down with her
in one hand,&rdquo; concluded Mary Louise. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
not so easy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drop her over to that branch you swung up
by, and I&rsquo;ll get her from there,&rdquo; suggested Jane.</p>
<p>A moment later Mary Louise was at her
chum&rsquo;s side, stroking the little black kitten, now
purring contentedly in Jane&rsquo;s arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder whose it is,&rdquo; she remarked. &ldquo;There
isn&rsquo;t any house near&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Except old Miss Grant&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both girls turned and looked at the hill which
rose at the right of the lonely road on which
they had been walking. The house, a large drab
plaster building, was barely visible through the
dark cedars that surrounded it on all sides. A
high, thick hedge, taller than an average-sized
man, gave the place an even greater aspect of
gloominess and seclusion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it is Miss Grant&rsquo;s kitten,&rdquo; suggested
Jane. &ldquo;Old maids are supposed to like cats, you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise&rsquo;s brown eyes sparkled with
anticipation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope it is!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;And then we&rsquo;ll
get a look at the inside of that house. Because
everybody says it&rsquo;s supposed to be haunted. Our
colored laundress&rsquo;s little girl was walking past it
one evening about dusk, and she heard the most
terrible moan. She claims that two eyes, without
any head or body, looked out through the hedge
at her. She dropped her bundle and ran as fast
as she could for home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t really believe there is anything,
do you, Mary Lou?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. There must be something
queer about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe there&rsquo;s a crazy woman shut up in the
tower.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been reading <i>Jane Eyre</i>, haven&rsquo;t you,
Jane? But there isn&rsquo;t any tower on the Grant
house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I guess Miss Grant is crazy enough
herself. She dresses in styles of forty years ago.
Did you ever see her?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">[14]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve had a glimpse of her once or twice
when I walked past here. She looks like the picture
of the old maid on the old-maid cards. It
must be awful for that girl who lives with her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What girl?&rdquo; inquired Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A niece, I believe. She must be about our
age. Her father and mother both died, so she
has to live with Miss Grant. They say the old
lady treats her terribly&mdash;much worse than the
two old servants she keeps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While this conversation was going on, the two
girls, followed by Silky, were walking slowly up
the hill towards the big hedge which surrounded
the Grant place. Once inside the yard, it was
almost like being in a deep, thick woods. Cedar
trees completely enclosed the house and grew
thick on both sides of the narrow path leading
from the gate to the porch. In spite of the fact
that it was broad daylight, Jane found herself
shuddering. But Mary Louise seemed delighted
with the strange, gloomy atmosphere.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t this girl go to high school?&rdquo; asked
Jane. &ldquo;If she&rsquo;s about our age&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe so. I never saw her there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They stopped when they reached the steps of
the porch and looked about with curiosity. It
certainly was a run-down place. Boards were
broken in the steps, and pieces of plaster had
crumbled from the outer wall. The grayish-colored
ivy which grew over the house seemed
to emphasize its aspect of the past.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t Miss Grant supposed to be rich?&rdquo;
whispered Jane incredulously. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t look
like it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They say she&rsquo;s a miser. Hoards every cent
she can get.&rdquo; Mary Louise smiled. &ldquo;I believe I&rsquo;ll
tell Daddy to report her for hoarding. She deserves
it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better wait and find out whether she really
is rich, hadn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; returned Jane. &ldquo;Your
father&rsquo;s a busy man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise nodded and looked at her dog.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You lie down, Silky,&rdquo; she commanded, &ldquo;and
wait here for us. Miss Grant probably wouldn&rsquo;t
like you. She might think you&rsquo;d hurt Pussy.&rdquo; She
smiled indulgently. &ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t know you belong
to the Dog Scouts and do a kind act every
day&mdash;like rescuing cats in distress!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The spaniel obeyed, and the two girls
mounted the rickety steps of the porch. Although
it was late in June, the door was closed
tightly, and they had to pull a rusty knocker to
let the people inside know that they were there.</p>
<p>It was some minutes before there was any
reply.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</div>
<p>A sad-faced girl in an old-fashioned purple
calico dress finally opened the door and stared
at them with big gray eyes. The length of her
dress, the way her blond hair was pulled back
and pinned into a tight knot, made her seem
much older than her visitors.</p>
<p>A suggestion of a smile crossed her face at the
sight of the girls&rsquo; pleasant faces, and for a second
she looked almost pretty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this your kitten?&rdquo; asked Mary Louise.
&ldquo;We rescued it from a tree down the road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. It belongs to my aunt Mattie. Come in,
and I&rsquo;ll call her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls stepped into the dark square hall
and looked about them. The inside of the house
was even more forbidding than the outside. The
ceilings were high and the wall paper dark.
All the shutters were drawn, as if there were
poison in the June sunlight. For no reason at
all that they could see, the old stairs suddenly
creaked.</p>
<p>Jane shuddered visibly, and the girl in the
purple dress smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mind the queer noises,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;Nothing ever happens in daytime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then something does happen after dark?&rdquo;
questioned Mary Louise eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. Why, only two nights ago&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this? What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; demanded the
sharp, high voice of an old woman. &ldquo;What are
you standing there talking about, Elsie? With
all those peaches waiting to be pared!&rdquo;</p>
<p>All eyes turned naturally towards the old
staircase, from which the sound of the voice was
coming. Miss Grant slowly descended, holding
her hand on her right side and grunting to herself
as if the act of walking were painful to her.
She was a woman of at least sixty-five, thin and
wrinkled, but with little sharp black beady eyes
that seemed to peer into everything suspiciously,
as if she believed the whole world evil. She was
wearing an old-fashioned black dress, and a
dark shawl about her shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These girls have found your kitten, Aunt
Mattie,&rdquo; Elsie informed her. &ldquo;They rescued her
from a tree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The black eyes softened, and the old woman
came towards the girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My precious little Puffy!&rdquo; she exclaimed, as
one might talk to a baby. Then her tone abruptly
became harsh again as she turned to her
niece.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go back to your work, Elsie!&rdquo; she ordered
gruffly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll attend to this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without any reply the girl slunk away to the
kitchen, and Miss Grant took the kitten from
Jane.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me what happened to my poor little
pet,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Briefly Jane repeated the story, with an
emphasis upon Mary Louise&rsquo;s prowess in climbing
trees.</p>
<p>Apparently the old lady was touched.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must say that was good of you,&rdquo; she remarked.
&ldquo;Not a bit like what most young people
nowadays would do! All they seem to enjoy
is torturing poor helpless creatures!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She put the kitten down on the floor and
turned towards the stairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wait!&rdquo; she commanded the girls, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
going to get you a reward for this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, Miss Grant!&rdquo; they both protested
instantly, and Mary Louise went on to explain
that they were Girl Scouts and never accepted
money for good turns. (Even Silky knows better
than that, she added to herself. He won&rsquo;t
expect a bone for rescuing Pussy&mdash;only a pat on
the head!)</p>
<p>&ldquo;You really mean that?&rdquo; demanded Miss
Grant, in obvious relief. She would save two
cents! She had meant to give each girl a whole
penny!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me your names, then,&rdquo; she continued,
&ldquo;and where you live. I might want to call on
you for help sometime. I can&rsquo;t trust my niece
as far as my nose, and my servants are both old.&rdquo;
Mary Louise chuckled. So there was a mystery
in this house! A lurking danger that Miss
Grant and her niece both feared! And she and
Jane were being drawn into it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jane Patterson and Mary Louise Gay,&rdquo; she
replied. &ldquo;We live over in Riverside, next to the
high school. You can get us on the phone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t a telephone. Too expensive. Besides,
if I had one, I couldn&rsquo;t tell what deviltry
Elsie might be up to.... No, I don&rsquo;t hold
with these modern inventions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you could send Elsie for us if you need
any help,&rdquo; suggested Jane. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a little
over a mile. You see, Mary Louise&rsquo;s father is a
detective on the police force, and we&rsquo;re both
interested in mysteries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not thinking of any mystery,&rdquo; snapped
Miss Grant. &ldquo;What I&rsquo;m thinking of is <i>facts</i>. One
fact is that I&rsquo;ve got a pack of scheming relations
who are trying to send me off to the hospital
for an operation while they loot my house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise&rsquo;s forehead wrinkled in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you had any relations besides
your niece,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly I have. Haven&rsquo;t you ever heard of
the Grants in Riverside? Mrs. Grace Grant&mdash;a
woman about my age? She has two grown sons
and a married daughter. Well, they spent all
their money, and now they want mine. But
they&rsquo;re not going to get it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her hand went to her side again, as if she
were in pain, and Mary Louise decided it was
time for them to go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, good-bye, Miss Grant,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And
don&rsquo;t forget to call on us if you want help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a relief to be out in the bright sunlight
again, away from the gloom and the decay of
that ugly house. Mary Louise took a deep
breath and whistled for Silky. He was waiting
at the foot of the porch steps.</p>
<p>As they walked down the path they were
startled by a rustle in one of the cedar trees.
Silky perked up his ears and went to investigate
the disturbance. In another moment a head
peered cautiously through the branches. It was
Elsie Grant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you come over here and talk to me a
little while?&rdquo; she whispered, as if she were
afraid of being caught. &ldquo;I never see any girls
my own age&mdash;and&mdash;you look so nice!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both Mary Louise and Jane were touched by
the loneliness of this poor unhappy orphan.
They went gladly to her side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you go to school?&rdquo; asked Mary Louise.
&ldquo;I mean&mdash;when it isn&rsquo;t vacation time?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</div>
<p>The girl shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That must be awful!&rdquo; exclaimed Jane.
&ldquo;Sometimes I hate school, but I&rsquo;d certainly hate
worse never to go. How old are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m only fifteen,&rdquo; replied Elsie. &ldquo;But it seems
as if I were fifty. I mean&mdash;the time is so long.
Yet I&rsquo;ve really only lived here with Aunt Mattie
two years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And didn&rsquo;t you ever go to school?&rdquo; questioned
Mary Louise. She couldn&rsquo;t believe that,
for the girl spoke beautiful English.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes&mdash;before I came here. I was just
ready to enter high school when mother died&mdash;only
a couple of months after my father was
killed in an accident. He was Aunt Mattie&rsquo;s
youngest brother. And he didn&rsquo;t leave any
money, so I had to come and live with her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t see why she doesn&rsquo;t send you to
school,&rdquo; protested Jane. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a public high
school. It wouldn&rsquo;t cost her anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it would, because I haven&rsquo;t any clothes
except these old things of hers. I can&rsquo;t go anywhere&mdash;I&rsquo;m
too ashamed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise&rsquo;s eyes gleamed with indignation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s terrible!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;We can report
her&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elsie shook her head.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, you couldn&rsquo;t. Because she feeds me well
enough and gives me clothing that is clean, and
warm enough in winter. No, there isn&rsquo;t a thing
anybody can do. Except wait until I&rsquo;m old
enough to work in somebody&rsquo;s kitchen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; protested Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I thought if I could just see you two
girls once in a while and talk to you, life
wouldn&rsquo;t seem so bad. If I could call you by
your first names&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you can,&rdquo; Mary Louise assured
her, and she told Elsie their names. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll come
over often. And I don&rsquo;t believe your aunt will
object, because she seems to like us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She loves that kitten,&rdquo; explained Elsie. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
the only thing in the world she does love, besides
money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She mentioned her money,&rdquo; remarked Jane,
&ldquo;and told us that she believed her relatives were
trying to get it away from her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; said Mary Louise, &ldquo;you started
to tell us about something that happened here
two nights ago. Remember? What was it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elsie shivered, as though the memory of it
were still painful to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sleep up in the attic, all by myself. And I
hear the most awful noises all night. I&rsquo;m always
scared to death to go to bed.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t the servants sleep there too?&rdquo; asked
Mary Louise. She was anxious to get her facts
straight from the beginning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. They sleep on the second floor, in a
room over the kitchen. There are just two of
them&mdash;an old married couple named Hannah
and William Groben.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, night before last I heard more distinct
noises than ever. First I thought it was one of
the trees near my window, and I nerved myself
to get out of bed and look out. And what do you
think I saw?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A ghost?&rdquo; whispered Jane, in awe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t think so. I believe it was a human
being. Anyway, all I saw was two bright eyes
peering in at the window!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you do?&rdquo; demanded Mary Louise
breathlessly. &ldquo;Scream?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t. Once before I screamed, and
Aunt Mattie had William investigate everything,
and when he found nobody I was punished
for my foolishness. I had to eat bread and
water for two days. And it taught me a lesson.
I never screamed again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what happened?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think whoever it was climbed from the tree
into the attic storeroom window and went
through an old trunk in there. I heard a little
noise, but I couldn&rsquo;t tell whether it was only the
wind or not. Anyway, nothing was known about
it till yesterday, when Aunt Mattie went up to
look for something in her trunk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you tell her then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tried to. But she wouldn&rsquo;t listen. She
accused me of going through her trunk. But I
wasn&rsquo;t punished, because nothing was stolen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it couldn&rsquo;t have been a robber,&rdquo; said
Mary Louise. &ldquo;Or something would have been
taken. Wasn&rsquo;t there anything else in the house
missing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a thing! Hannah even counted the silver
and found it was all there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How does Hannah account for it? Or does
she think, like your aunt, that you did it?&rdquo; questioned
Mary Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hannah says it was &lsquo;spirits.&rsquo; She says the
spirits can&rsquo;t rest as long as their old things are
around. She wants Aunt Mattie to burn or give
away all the old clothing in the house. She says
dead people&rsquo;s clothes are possessed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane let out a peal of laughter, but Mary
Louise warned her to be quiet. &ldquo;We mustn&rsquo;t get
Elsie into trouble,&rdquo; she explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was that the only time anything like that
ever happened?&rdquo; asked Jane.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No. Once, earlier in the spring, when Hannah
and William were away at some lodge supper,
their room was entered and searched. I was
blamed and punished then, though nothing was
missing that time, either. But the awful part of
it is: I expect it to happen again every night.
Every time the wind howls or a branch beats
against a windowpane, I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;re coming
again&mdash;whoever they are. And&mdash;I&rsquo;m afraid!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something&rsquo;s got to be done!&rdquo; announced
Mary Louise, with determination. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not my
father&rsquo;s daughter if I allow a mysterious outrage
like this to go on.&rdquo; She pressed Elsie&rsquo;s hand.
&ldquo;You can count on us,&rdquo; she concluded. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
be back to see you tomorrow!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">CHAPTER II</span>
<br /><i>The Robbery</i></h2>
<p>The house in which Mary Louise&rsquo;s family
lived was as different from the Grants&rsquo; as day is
from night. It was painted white, and its smooth
green lawn was dotted here and there with
bright flower beds. Modern, airy, and filled with
sunshine, the house itself looked like the home
of a happy family, which the Gays were&mdash;as
their name implied.</p>
<p>Mary Louise&rsquo;s young brother&mdash;always called
&ldquo;Freckles&rdquo;&mdash;was setting the breakfast table
when she came downstairs the morning after her
visit to Dark Cedars. It was Mary Louise&rsquo;s task
to put the bedding to air while her mother
cooked breakfast. Mrs. Gay did not keep a
maid, and both children did their share of the
work.</p>
<p>As they sat down to breakfast Mary Louise
could not help contrasting her life with poor
Elsie Grant&rsquo;s. Thinking how different, how
cheerful everything was here&mdash;though of course
it was never quite the same when her father was
away on a case, as so happened at the present
time. Mary Louise wanted to do something to
help Elsie, besides just visiting her. She had a
sudden inspiration.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I have a lot of clothes, haven&rsquo;t I, Mother?&rdquo;
she inquired as she spread marmalade on her
toast.</p>
<p>Mrs. Gay smiled. She was a pretty woman,
with the same dark hair and dark eyes as her
daughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t say that, dear,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;I
think you have enough. But if there is something
you specially want, I guess you can have
it. Is that why you ask?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Mary Louise laughingly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
just the other way around. Instead of buying
more, what I want to do is to give some away.
A couple of dresses, perhaps, and some lingerie.
And a pair of slippers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Gay nodded approvingly. Being both a
neat housekeeper and a charitable woman, she
loved to clear things out and, if possible, give
them to someone who could use them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I was thinking of making up
a package to send to the Salvation Army today.
That old blue sweater of yours could go, and
the red woolen dress&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No! No!&rdquo; interrupted Mary Louise. &ldquo;I
didn&rsquo;t mean things like that, Mother. I want to
give away a couple of nice dresses. Like my
green flowered silk, for instance, and my pink
linen. May I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Mary Louise! I thought you especially
liked those dresses. What&rsquo;s the matter with
them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing. I do like them a lot. That&rsquo;s why
I chose them. I want to give them to a girl who
hasn&rsquo;t had a new dress for over two years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is she?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Gay sympathetically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A niece of old Miss Grant. You know&mdash;that
queer old maid who lives at Dark Cedars. About
a mile out of town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her mother nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know where you mean, dear. But that
woman is reputed to be rich&mdash;much better off
than we are. I can&rsquo;t understand&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you can&rsquo;t, Mother, unless you see
poor Elsie Grant. She&rsquo;s about my age&mdash;a year
younger, to be exact&mdash;and she&rsquo;s an orphan. Two
years ago, when her mother died, she came to
live with Miss Grant because she hadn&rsquo;t anywhere
to go and no money. And the old lady
treats her shamefully. Dresses her in those old
calico dresses that servants used to wear years
ago. So Elsie can&rsquo;t go anywhere, not even to
school.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</div>
<p>Mrs. Gay&rsquo;s lips closed tightly, and her eyes
narrowed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s the kind of woman Miss Grant is!&rdquo;
she muttered. &ldquo;I always knew she was queer, but
I never thought she was cruel.... Yes, of
course you can give the girl some clothing, dear.
Go pick out anything you want, except those
brand-new things we bought last week for our
trip in August.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise lost no time in making her selection.
She piled the clothing on her bed, after
she had put her room in order, and called her
mother in for her approval. But before tying up
the package she whistled for Jane from her window.</p>
<p>Her chum came running across the grass that
grew between the two houses and bounded up
the steps. Briefly Mary Louise explained what
she was doing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I want to give Elsie something too,&rdquo;
Jane said. &ldquo;She ought to have some kind of summer
coat and a hat. Wait till I ask Mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She returned in less than five minutes bringing
a lovely white wool coat and a white felt hat to
match it. Mary Louise tied up the bundle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please ask Freckles to take care of Silky this
morning, Mother,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that
perhaps Miss Grant might not like him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</div>
<p>The girls started off immediately through the
streets of Riverside to the lonely road that led to
Dark Cedars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sort of wish we had Silky with us,&rdquo; observed
Jane as they approached the house. &ldquo;He
is a protection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there isn&rsquo;t anything to protect us from!
Elsie said nothing ever happened in the daytime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A stifled sob coming from under the cedar
trees caused the girls to stop abruptly and peer
in among the low branches. There, half concealed
by the thick growth, sat Elsie Grant, crying
bitterly.</p>
<p>Mary Louise and Jane were beside her in a
second.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Elsie?&rdquo; demanded Mary
Louise. &ldquo;What happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl raised her tear-stained face and
attempted to smile. For Mary Louise and Jane
came nearest to being her friends of all the people
in the world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aunt Mattie has been robbed,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;And&mdash;everybody thinks I did it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You!&rdquo; cried Jane. &ldquo;Oh, how awful!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</div>
<p>The girls sat down on the ground beside her
and asked her to tell them all about it. The
bundle of clothing was forgotten for the time
being in this new, overwhelming catastrophe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My aunt has a big old safe in her room, that
she always keeps locked,&rdquo; Elsie began. &ldquo;She
hasn&rsquo;t any faith in banks, she says, because they
are always closing, so all her money is in this
safe. I&rsquo;ve often heard Aunt Grace try to make
Aunt Mattie stop hoarding, but Aunt Mattie always
refuses. She loves to have it where she can
see it and count it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A regular miser,&rdquo; remarked Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. It&rsquo;s her one joy in life&mdash;besides the little
kitten. Every morning after breakfast she
opens that safe and counts her money over
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t she ever spend any?&rdquo; asked Mary
Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little, of course. She pays William and
Hannah a small amount, and she buys some
food, especially in winter. But we have a garden,
you know, and chickens and a cow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When did she miss this money?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">[32]</div>
<p>&ldquo;This morning. It was there yesterday. Aunt
Mattie counted it right after you girls went
home. You can hear her say the figures out loud
and sort of chuckle to herself. But today she just
let out a scream. It was horrible! I thought she
was dying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it was taken last night,&rdquo; said Mary
Louise. &ldquo;Did you hear any of those queer noises&mdash;I
mean the kind you heard before, when you
thought somebody searched that old trunk in
the attic?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t. That&rsquo;s the worst part. Nobody
else heard anything, either, all night long, and
no door locks were broken. Of course, a burglar
might have entered over the front porch roof,
through Aunt Mattie&rsquo;s window. But she&rsquo;s a light
sleeper, and she says she never heard a sound.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So of course she claims you stole it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elsie nodded and started to cry again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I didn&rsquo;t! I give you my word I didn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you didn&rsquo;t, Elsie. We believe you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aunt Mattie did everything but torture me
to get a confession out of me. She said if I didn&rsquo;t
own up to it and give it back she&rsquo;d send me to a
reform school, and I&rsquo;d be branded as a criminal
for the rest of my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She couldn&rsquo;t do that!&rdquo; exclaimed Mary
Louise furiously. &ldquo;If she has no proof ... I&rsquo;ll
tell you what I&rsquo;ll do, Elsie! I&rsquo;ll put my father
on the case when he comes home! He&rsquo;s a detective
on the police force, and he&rsquo;s just wonderful.
He&rsquo;ll find the real thief.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</div>
<p>Elsie shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m afraid you can&rsquo;t do that. Because
Aunt Mattie distinctly said that she won&rsquo;t have
the police meddling in this. She says that if I
didn&rsquo;t steal the money somebody else in the
family did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What family?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aunt Grace&rsquo;s family. She&rsquo;s the Mrs. Grant,
you know, who lives in Riverside. She has three
grown-up children and one grandchild. Aunt
Mattie says one of these relatives is guilty, if
I&rsquo;m not, and she&rsquo;ll find out herself, without
bringing shame upon the Grant name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise groaned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The only thing I can see for us to do, then,
is to be detectives ourselves. Jane and I will do
all we can to help you, won&rsquo;t we, Jane?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her chum nodded. &ldquo;At least, if we don&rsquo;t have
to get into any spookiness at night,&rdquo; she
amended. &ldquo;Those mysterious sounds you told us
about, Elsie&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They may all have some connection with this
robbery,&rdquo; announced Mary Louise. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;d
like to find out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elsie looked doubtful.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I only hope Aunt Mattie doesn&rsquo;t try the
bread-and-water diet on me, to get a confession.
Really, you have no idea how awful that is till
you try it. You just get crazy for some real food.
You&rsquo;d be almost willing to lie to get it, even if
you knew the lie was going to hurt you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If she tries that, you let us know,&rdquo; cried
Jane angrily, &ldquo;and we&rsquo;ll bring our parents right
over here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, I will.&rdquo; Elsie seemed to find some
relief in the promise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elsie,&rdquo; said Mary Louise very seriously, &ldquo;tell
me who you really think did steal the money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl considered the problem carefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe it was somebody in Aunt Grace&rsquo;s
family,&rdquo; she replied slowly. &ldquo;Because they used
to be rich, and now they are poor. And I think
that if a burglar had entered the house, somebody,
probably Aunt Mattie, would have wakened
up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t he have entered before your aunt
went to bed?&rdquo; suggested Mary Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe. But Aunt Mattie was on the front
porch all evening, and she&rsquo;d probably have
heard him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, then,&rdquo; agreed Mary Louise. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
drop the idea of the burglar for the time being.
Let&rsquo;s hear about the family&mdash;your aunt Grace&rsquo;s
family, I mean.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">[35]</div>
<p>She reached into her pocket and took out a
pencil and notebook, which she had provided
for the purpose of writing down any items of
clothing that Elsie might particularly want. Instead
of that, she would list the possible suspects,
the way her father usually did when he
was working on a murder case.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready now. Tell
me how many brothers and sisters your aunt
Mattie had, and everything else you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aunt Mattie had only two brothers, and not
any sisters at all. My father was one brother, and
Aunt Grace&rsquo;s husband was the other. They&rsquo;re
both dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then your aunt Grace isn&rsquo;t your aunt Mattie&rsquo;s
real sister?&rdquo; inquired Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. But Aunt Mattie seems to like her better
than any of her blood relations, even if she is
only a sister-in-law. She comes over here pretty
often.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe she took the money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elsie looked shocked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not Aunt Grace! She&rsquo;s too religious. Always
going to church and talking about right and
wrong. She even argued with Aunt Mattie to
let me go to Sunday school, but Aunt Mattie
wouldn&rsquo;t buy me a decent dress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the mention of clothing, Jane reached for
the package they had carried with them to
Dark Cedars, but Mary Louise shook her head,
signalling her to wait until Elsie had finished.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, anyway, Aunt Mattie&rsquo;s father liked
her better than her two brothers, and he
promised to leave her his money if she wouldn&rsquo;t
get married while he was alive. And she didn&rsquo;t,
you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess nobody ever asked her,&rdquo; remarked
Jane bluntly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what my mother used to say,&rdquo; agreed
Elsie. &ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t like Aunt Mattie, and Aunt
Mattie hated her. So it&rsquo;s no wonder I&rsquo;m not welcome
here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise called Elsie back to her facts by
tapping her pencil on her notebook.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So far I have only one relative written
down,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s your aunt Grace.
Please go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I told you, I think,&rdquo; Elsie continued immediately,
&ldquo;Aunt Grace has three grown children.
Two boys and a girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Names, please,&rdquo; commanded Mary Louise
in her most practical tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;John Grant, Harry Grant, and Mrs. Ellen
Grant Pearson. The daughter is married.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How old are they?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">[37]</div>
<p>&ldquo;All about forty, I guess. I don&rsquo;t know.
Middle-aged&mdash;no, I guess you wouldn&rsquo;t call
Harry middle-aged. He&rsquo;s the youngest. Except,
of course, the granddaughter&mdash;Mrs. Pearson&rsquo;s
only child. She&rsquo;s a girl about eighteen or nineteen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s her name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Corinne&mdash;Corinne Pearson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that everybody?&rdquo; asked Mary Louise. &ldquo;I
mean, all the living relatives of Miss Mattie
Grant?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise read her list aloud, just to make
sure that she had gotten the names correctly and
to impress them upon her own mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Grace Grant&mdash;aged about sixty-five,
sister-in-law of Miss Mattie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;John Grant&mdash;middle-aged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ellen Grant Pearson&mdash;middle-aged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Harry Grant&mdash;about thirty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Corinne Pearson&mdash;about nineteen....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you forgot me!&rdquo; Elsie reminded her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we didn&rsquo;t forget you, either,&rdquo; replied
Mary Louise, with a smile. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got something
for you&mdash;in that package.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something to make you forget your troubles,&rdquo;
added Jane. &ldquo;Some new clothes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s eyes lighted up with joy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honestly? Oh, that&rsquo;s wonderful! Let me see
them!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</div>
<p>Mary Louise untied the package and held the
things up for Elsie to look at. The girl&rsquo;s expression
was one of positive rapture. A silk dress!
In the latest style! And the kind of soft wooly
coat she had always dreamed of possessing! A
hat that was a real hat&mdash;not one of those outlandish
sunbonnets her aunt Mattie made her wear!
Dainty lingerie&mdash;and a pair of white shoes!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s too much!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t
take them! They&rsquo;re your best things&mdash;I know
they are.&rdquo; And once again her eyes filled with
tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have other nice clothes,&rdquo; Mary Louise
assured her. &ldquo;And our mothers said it was all
right. So you must take them: we&rsquo;d be hurt if
you didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honestly?&rdquo; The girl looked as if she could
not believe there was so much goodness in the
world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Absolutely! Now&mdash;don&rsquo;t you want to go in
and try them on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it right here,&rdquo; said Elsie. &ldquo;These
cedars are so thick that nobody can see me. And
if I went into the house they might not let me
out again to show you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</div>
<p>With trembling fingers she pulled off her
shoes and stockings, and the old calico dress she
was wearing, and put on the silk slip and the
green flowered dress. Then the white stockings
and the slippers, which fitted beautifully. And
last of all, the coat.</p>
<p>Her eyes were sparkling now, and her feet
were taking little dancing steps of delight. Elsie
Grant looked like a different person!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonderful!&rdquo; cried Mary Louise and Jane
in the same breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only&mdash;let me fix your hair,&rdquo; suggested the
former. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s naturally curly, isn&rsquo;t it? But you
have it drawn back so tightly you can scarcely
see any wave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to wear it like yours, Mary Louise,&rdquo;
replied the orphan wistfully. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s too long,
and I have no money for barbers or beauty parlors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see what we can do next time we
come,&rdquo; answered Mary Louise. &ldquo;But let&rsquo;s loosen
it up a bit now and put your knot down low on
your neck so that the hat will fit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Deftly she fluffed it out a little at the sides and
pinned it in a modish style. Then she put the
little white felt hat on Elsie&rsquo;s head at just
the correct angle and stepped back to survey the
transformed girl with pride.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re positively a knockout, Elsie!&rdquo; she exclaimed
in delight. &ldquo;Take my word for it, you&rsquo;re
going to be a big hit in Riverside.&rdquo; She chuckled
to herself. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll all lose our boy-friends when
they see you!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no!&rdquo; protested Elsie seriously. &ldquo;You are
really beautiful, Mary Louise! And so clever
and good. And so is Jane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both girls smiled at Elsie&rsquo;s extravagant praise.
Then Mary Louise turned back to her notebook.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to hear more about yesterday,&rdquo; she
said: &ldquo;whether you think any of these five relatives
had a chance to steal that money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They all had a chance,&rdquo; answered Elsie.
&ldquo;They were all here&mdash;and all up in Aunt Mattie&rsquo;s
room at some time or other during the day
or evening!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">CHAPTER III</span>
<br /><i>Suspects</i></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s sit down again while you tell me every
single thing that happened here yesterday,&rdquo; suggested
Mary Louise.</p>
<p>Elsie took off the white coat and folded it
carefully. Then she removed her hat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t sit down in this silk dress,&rdquo; she
objected. &ldquo;I might get it dirty, and I don&rsquo;t want
to take it off till I see myself in a mirror. I might
not have another chance to put it on all day
long!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can sit on the paper,&rdquo; advised Jane.
&ldquo;That will protect it. Besides, the ground is dry,
and these needles are a covering.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Very cautiously Elsie seated herself, and
turned to Mary Louise, who had dropped down
beside her on the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Begin when you got up in the morning,&rdquo; she
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was about seven o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; replied Elsie.
&ldquo;But really, that doesn&rsquo;t matter, because I&rsquo;m
sure Aunt Mattie counted her money after you
girls brought the kitten back. I heard her. And
she stayed in her room until after lunch.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Does this safe have a combination lock?&rdquo;
inquired Mary Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it doesn&rsquo;t. Just a key. John Grant suggested
to Aunt Mattie that she have one put on,
and she refused. She said people can guess at
combinations of figures by twisting the handle
around, but if she kept the key with her day and
night, nobody could open the safe.... But she
got fooled!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The lock was broken?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. But the door of the safe was closed, so
she hadn&rsquo;t noticed it until she went to count her
money this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know how much was taken?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t. Plenty, I guess. Only, there was
one queer thing about it: the thief didn&rsquo;t take
the bonds she kept in a special drawer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Overlooked them, probably,&rdquo; remarked
Mary Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe. I don&rsquo;t know. Well, as I said, Aunt
Mattie was in her room until lunch time, and
then she went out on the front porch. About two
o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon Aunt Grace and her son
John drove over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;John&mdash;Grant,&rdquo; repeated Mary Louise, consulting
the list in her notebook. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s your aunt
Grace&rsquo;s oldest son?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. He&rsquo;s about forty, as I said. Fat and a
little bit bald. An old bachelor. Probably you&rsquo;d
recognize him if you saw him, because he&rsquo;s on
the School Board. Aunt Mattie likes him because
he does little repair jobs for her around
the house that save her spending money for a
carpenter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yesterday he went upstairs and fixed a window
sash in her bedroom.&rdquo; Elsie paused thoughtfully.
&ldquo;So you see John had a good chance to
open the safe and steal the money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, he&rsquo;s the guilty one, of course!&rdquo; cried
Jane instantly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just too plain. I should
think your aunt would see that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elsie shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it would never occur to Aunt Mattie to
accuse John. He&rsquo;s the one person in the family
she trusts. She always says she is leaving him
all her money in her will&mdash;so why would he
bother to steal it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He might need it now, for some particular
purpose,&rdquo; replied Jane. &ldquo;He is handy with
tools, you say&mdash;and had such a good opportunity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We better get on with the story,&rdquo; urged
Mary Louise. &ldquo;Any minute Elsie may be called
in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl shuddered, as if she dreaded the
ordeal of meeting her aunt again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Was your aunt Grace in the bedroom at all
during the afternoon?&rdquo; questioned Mary Louise.
&ldquo;By herself, I mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. She and Aunt Mattie went up
together to look at the window after John finished
fixing it, but whether or not Aunt Grace
was there alone, I couldn&rsquo;t say. Anyhow, there&rsquo;s
no use worrying about that. Aunt Grace just
<i>couldn&rsquo;t</i> steal anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;According to the detective stories,&rdquo; put in
Jane, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the person who just <i>couldn&rsquo;t</i> commit
the crime who always is the guilty one. The one
you suspect least.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this isn&rsquo;t a story,&rdquo; said Elsie. &ldquo;I wish it
were. If you knew how dreadful it is for me, living
here and having everybody think I&rsquo;m a
thief!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you run away, now that you have
some decent clothes?&rdquo; suggested Jane. &ldquo;I just
wouldn&rsquo;t stand for anything like that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I have nowhere to go. Besides, running
away would make me look guiltier than ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elsie&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; approved Mary Louise. &ldquo;She
can&rsquo;t run away now. But we&rsquo;ll prove she&rsquo;s innocent!&rdquo;
she added, with determination.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something else that happened during
that visit,&rdquo; continued Elsie. &ldquo;I mean, while
Aunt Grace and John were here. Part of a conversation
I overhead that may give you a clue.
Aunt Grace said her youngest son&mdash;Harry, you
remember&mdash;had gotten into debt and needed
some money very badly. She didn&rsquo;t actually ask
Aunt Mattie to help him out: she only hinted.
But she didn&rsquo;t get any encouragement from
Aunt Mattie. She told Aunt Grace just to shut
Harry out of the house till he learned to behave
himself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So this Harry Grant is in debt!&rdquo; muttered
Mary Louise, making a note of this fact in her
little book. &ldquo;Could he have stolen the money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s possible. After Aunt Grace and John
went home, Harry came over to Dark Cedars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What time was that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Around four o&rsquo;clock, I think. I was out in the
kitchen, helping Hannah shell some peas for
supper. We heard his car&mdash;it&rsquo;s a terribly noisy
old thing&mdash;and then his voice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s he like?&rdquo; asked Mary Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you he was the youngest of Aunt
Grace&rsquo;s children, you know, and he&rsquo;s rather
handsome. He treats me much better than any of
the other relations, except Aunt Grace, but still
I don&rsquo;t like him. He always insists on kissing me
and teasing me about imaginary boy-friends. I
usually run out into the kitchen when I hear him
coming.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Is he here often?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only when he wants something. He tries to
flatter Aunt Mattie and tease her money away
from her. But, as far as I know, he never gets
any.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did he want yesterday?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said he wanted a loan. He didn&rsquo;t bother
to talk quietly: I could hear every word he said
from the kitchen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And your aunt refused?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. She told him to sell his car if he needed
money. As if he could sell that old bus!&rdquo; Elsie
laughed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d have to pay somebody to take
that away,&rdquo; she explained.</p>
<p>Mary Louise tapped her pencil again. She
hated to get away from the all-important subject.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how do you think Harry could have
stolen the money if your aunt Mattie was with
him all the time?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aunt Mattie wasn&rsquo;t. He had a fine chance.
Something had gone wrong with his car, and
he had to fix it on the way over. So his hands
were all dirty, and he went upstairs to wash
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; exclaimed Jane significantly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Looks bad for Harry Grant,&rdquo; commented
Mary Louise, &ldquo;because he had a motive. Daddy
always looks for two things when he&rsquo;s solving
a crime: the motive, and the chance to get away
with it. And it seems that this young man had
both.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elsie nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he had. And he was upstairs a good
while, too. But then, he&rsquo;s an awful dandy about
everything. You never see grease in Harry
Grant&rsquo;s finger nails!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he go right out when he came downstairs?&rdquo;
inquired Mary Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. He laughed and joked a lot. I heard him
ask Aunt Mattie to lend him her finger-nail
rouge because he had forgotten his. Then he
said he&rsquo;d like some cookies, and I had to make
lemonade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, if he took the money, he must have had
it in his pocket all this time? He didn&rsquo;t go upstairs
again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he didn&rsquo;t. And I know Aunt Mattie
had a good deal of it in gold, so it must have
been terribly heavy. Still, men have a lot of
pockets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise nodded. &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s true. But
you&rsquo;d think if he really had taken it he&rsquo;d have
been anxious to get away. That story about asking
for cookies and lemonade almost proves an
alibi for him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</div>
<p>She sighed; it was all getting rather complicated.
&ldquo;Did anything else happen yesterday?&rdquo;
she asked wearily. &ldquo;I mean, after Harry went
home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not till after supper. Then Mrs. Pearson
and her daughter walked over to see Aunt Mattie.
They used to be rich, but Mr. Pearson lost
his job, and they had to sell their car. So now
they have to walk wherever they go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane let out a groan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So every one of those five relations of Miss
Grant was here yesterday and had a chance to
steal that money!&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; agreed Elsie. &ldquo;Every one of them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are the Pearsons like?&rdquo; asked Mary
Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Mrs. Pearson looks like Aunt Grace&mdash;she&rsquo;s
her daughter, you remember&mdash;but she isn&rsquo;t
a bit like her. She isn&rsquo;t religious; in fact, she
doesn&rsquo;t seem to care for anything in the world
but that nasty daughter of hers. Corinne, you
know. Have you ever seen Corinne Pearson?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I have,&rdquo; replied Mary Louise.
&ldquo;Though she never went to our school. I believe
she attended that little private school, and now
she goes around with the Country Club set,
doesn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Her one ambition, and her mother&rsquo;s
ambition for her, is to marry a rich man. I hate
both of them. They&rsquo;re so rude to me&mdash;never
speak to me at all unless they give me a command
as if I were a servant. Last night Corinne
told me to bring her a certain chair from the
parlor, because she thought our porch rockers
were dirty. And the tone she used! As if I ought
to keep them clean just for her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I always imagined she was like that,&rdquo; said
Jane. &ldquo;I was introduced to her once, and when I
passed her on the street the next day she cut me
dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once she told me to untie her shoe and see
if there was a stone in it,&rdquo; continued Elsie. &ldquo;In
the haughtiest tone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d have slapped her foot!&rdquo; exclaimed Jane.
&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t obey her, did you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had to. Aunt Mattie would have punished
me if I hadn&rsquo;t. She dislikes Corinne Pearson
and her mother, but she hates me worst of all....
So you can easily see why I run off when I
see the Pearsons coming. I went back into the
kitchen with Hannah, but Aunt Mattie soon
called me to bring some ice water. And the conversation
I heard may be another clue for you,
Mary Louise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear!&rdquo; sighed Jane. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got too
many clues already.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">[50]</div>
<p>A voice sounded from the house, making the
girls pause for a moment in silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elsie! Oh, Elsie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Hannah. I&rsquo;ll have to go in a minute,&rdquo;
said the girl, carefully getting to her feet, not
forgetting her new dress. &ldquo;But first I must tell
you about this conversation, because it&rsquo;s important.
It seems Corinne was invited to a very
swell dance by one of those rich Mason boys,
and she came over to ask Aunt Mattie for a new
dress. Aunt Mattie laughed at her&mdash;that nasty
cackle that she has. And then she said, &lsquo;Certainly
I&rsquo;ll give you a dress, Corinne. Go up to my closet
and pick out anything you want. You&rsquo;ll find
some old party dresses there!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I could see that Corinne was furious,
but she got up and went upstairs. And she did
pick out an old lace gown&mdash;I thought maybe she
was going to make it over. Perhaps she was just
using it to hide the money, if she did steal it....
Anyhow, she and her mother went home
in a few minutes, carrying the dress with
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise closed her notebook in confusion.
&ldquo;You better run along now, Elsie, or you&rsquo;ll
get punished,&rdquo; she advised.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">[51]</div>
<p>&ldquo;All right, I will,&rdquo; agreed the younger girl
as she gathered up her things. &ldquo;You know all
the suspects now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All but the servants,&rdquo; replied Mary Louise.
&ldquo;And if I can, I&rsquo;m going to interview Hannah
immediately.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">[52]</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">CHAPTER IV</span>
<br /><i>Interviewing Hannah</i></h2>
<p>Keeping under cover of the cedar trees, Mary
Louise and Jane followed Elsie Grant, at a discreet
distance, to the back of the house. Unlike
the front entrance, there was a screen at the
kitchen door, so the girls could hear Hannah&rsquo;s
exclamation at the sight of the transformation
in Elsie&rsquo;s appearance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My land!&rdquo; she cried in amazement. &ldquo;Where
did you get them clothes, Elsie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elsie laughed; the first normal, girlish laugh
that Mary Louise and Jane had ever heard from
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I look nice, Hannah?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;I
haven&rsquo;t seen myself yet in a mirror, but I&rsquo;m sure
I do. I feel so different.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You look swell, all right,&rdquo; agreed the servant.
&ldquo;But no credit to you! If that&rsquo;s what you
done with your aunt&rsquo;s money&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, Hannah!&rdquo; protested Elsie. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
wrong there. I didn&rsquo;t <i>buy</i> these things. They
were given to me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">[53]</div>
<p>The two girls were standing at the screen door
now, in full view, and Elsie beckoned for them
to come inside. &ldquo;These are my friends, Hannah.
The girls who rescued Aunt Mattie&rsquo;s kitten&mdash;remember?
And they brought me the clothes this
morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might be true, but nobody&rsquo;d believe it.
Folks don&rsquo;t give away nice things like that. I
know that, for I&rsquo;ve had a lot of &lsquo;hand-me-downs&rsquo;
in my life.... Besides, they fit you too good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we did bring them to Elsie,&rdquo; asserted
Jane. &ldquo;You can see that we&rsquo;re all about the same
size. And we can prove it by our mothers. We&rsquo;ll
bring them over&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll do nuthin&rsquo; of the kind!&rdquo; returned
Hannah. &ldquo;Miss Mattie don&rsquo;t want a lot of
strangers pokin&rsquo; into her house and her affairs.
Now, you two run along! And, Elsie, hurry up
and get out of that finery. Look at them dishes
waitin&rsquo; fer you in the sink!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl nodded and disappeared up the back
stairs, humming a little tune to herself as she
went. Mary Louise stood still.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We want to ask you a question or two, Hannah,&rdquo;
she explained. &ldquo;We want to help find the
thief who stole Miss Grant&rsquo;s money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman&rsquo;s nose shot up in the air, and a
stubborn look came over her face.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">[54]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo; she asked defiantly. &ldquo;And what
business is that of your&rsquo;n?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re making it our business,&rdquo; replied Mary
Louise patiently, &ldquo;because we&rsquo;re fond of Elsie.
We think it&rsquo;s terrible for her to be accused of
something she didn&rsquo;t do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know she didn&rsquo;t do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;we just know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That ain&rsquo;t no reason! Besides, what do you
know about Elsie Grant? Seen her a couple of
times and listened to her hard luck story and
believe you know all about her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But surely you don&rsquo;t believe Elsie stole that
money?&rdquo; demanded Jane. &ldquo;If she had, she&rsquo;d certainly
have run away immediately. Wouldn&rsquo;t
she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe&mdash;if she had the spirit. But, anyhow,
it ain&rsquo;t none of your business, and Miss Mattie
don&rsquo;t want it to get around. She don&rsquo;t want no
scandal. Now&mdash;get along with you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, Hannah!&rdquo; begged Mary Louise.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll promise not to tell anybody about the
robbery&mdash;not even our mothers. If you&rsquo;d just
answer a couple of questions&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman eyed her suspiciously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">[55]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You think maybe I done it?&rdquo; she demanded.
&ldquo;Well, I didn&rsquo;t! Miss Mattie knows how honest
I am. William too&mdash;that&rsquo;s me husband. We&rsquo;ve
been in this house ever since Miss Mattie was a
girl, and the whole family knows they can trust
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my goodness!&rdquo; exclaimed Mary Louise.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not suspecting <i>you</i>, Hannah! All I want is
a little information.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to the police and tell what
you know? Or to some detective?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. On my word of honor, no! Jane and I
are going to try to be detectives ourselves, that&rsquo;s
all. For Elsie&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman&rsquo;s expression softened. After all,
Mary Louise&rsquo;s brown eyes had a winning way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. Only hurry up. I got a lot of work
to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise smiled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be quick,&rdquo; she
promised. &ldquo;I just want to know whether you
think there was any time during the day or evening&mdash;before
Miss Grant went to bed&mdash;when a
burglar could have entered the house without
being seen or heard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hannah stopped beating the cake which she
had been mixing while this conversation was
taking place and gave the matter her entire consideration.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">[56]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let me think,&rdquo; she muttered. &ldquo;Not all mornin&rsquo;,
fer Miss Mattie was in her room herself.
Not in the afternoon, neither, fer there was too
many people around. All them relations come
over, and Miss Mattie was right on the front
parch&mdash;and I was here at the back.... No, I
don&rsquo;t see how anybody could have got in without
bein&rsquo; heard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about supper time?&rdquo; questioned Mary
Louise. &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t somebody have climbed in
over the porch roof while the family were eating
in the dining room?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s possible,&rdquo; answered Hannah. &ldquo;But it
ain&rsquo;t likely. Burglars ain&rsquo;t usually as quiet as all
that. No; I hold with Miss Mattie&mdash;that Elsie
or maybe that good-fer-nuthin&rsquo; Harry took the
money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise sighed and turned towards the
door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it wasn&rsquo;t Elsie,&rdquo; she said again.
&ldquo;But maybe you&rsquo;re right about Mr. Harry
Grant. I hope we find out.... By the way,&rdquo;
she added, &ldquo;you couldn&rsquo;t tell me just how much
was taken, could you, Hannah?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I couldn&rsquo;t. Miss Mattie didn&rsquo;t say....
Now, my advice to you girls is: fergit all about
it! It ain&rsquo;t none of your affairs, and Elsie ain&rsquo;t
a good companion fer you young ladies. She
ain&rsquo;t had no eddication, and probably, now she&rsquo;s
fifteen, her aunt&rsquo;ll put her into service as a
housemaid somewheres. And you won&rsquo;t want to
be associatin&rsquo; with no servant girl!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">[57]</div>
<p>Jane&rsquo;s eyes blazed with indignation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not fair!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;In a country like
America, where education is free. Anybody who
wants it has a right to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then she can git it at night school while she&rsquo;s
workin&rsquo;, if she sets her mind to it,&rdquo; remarked
Hannah complacently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Hannah, we thank you very much for
your help,&rdquo; concluded Mary Louise as she
opened the screen door. &ldquo;And&mdash;you&rsquo;ll see us
again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Neither girl said anything further until they
were outside the big hedge that surrounded
Dark Cedars. Both of them felt baffled by the
conflicting information they had gathered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I could put the whole affair up to
Daddy,&rdquo; observed Mary Louise, as they descended
the hill to the road. &ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t home now,
but he soon will be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; replied her chum. &ldquo;It
might get Elsie into trouble. And besides, we
gave our promise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be hard not to talk about it. Oh, dear,
if we only knew where and how to begin!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">[58]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I guess the first thing to do is to find out just
what was stolen,&rdquo; said Jane. &ldquo;That would make
it more definite, at least. We have heard that it
was money, but we don&rsquo;t know how much or
what kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s true&mdash;and it would help considerably
to know. For instance, if there was a lot of
gold, as Elsie seems to think, it would be practically
impossible for Harry Grant to have concealed
it in his pockets, or for Corinne Pearson
to have carried it back to Riverside without any
car. But if, on the other hand, it was mostly
paper money, it would be no trick at all for
either one of them to have made away with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The shrill screech of a loud horn attracted the
girls&rsquo; attention at that moment. A familiar horn,
whose sound could not be mistaken. It belonged
on the roadster owned by Max Miller, Mary
Louise&rsquo;s special boy-friend.</p>
<p>In another second the bright green car flashed
into view, came up to the girls, and stopped with
a sudden jamming on of the brakes. Two hatless
young men in flannel trousers and tennis
shirts jumped out of the front seat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What ho! and hi!&mdash;and greetings!&rdquo; cried
Max in delight. &ldquo;Where have you two been?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Taking a walk,&rdquo; answered Mary Louise
calmly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">[59]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Taking a walk!&rdquo; repeated Norman Wilder,
the other young man, who was usually at Jane&rsquo;s
elbow at parties and sports affairs. &ldquo;You mean&mdash;giving
<i>us</i> the air!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Giving <i>you</i> the air? In what way?&rdquo; Jane&rsquo;s
tone sounded severe, but her eyes were smiling
into Norman&rsquo;s, as if she were not at all sorry to
see him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forgot all about that tennis date we had,
didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; demanded Max. &ldquo;Is that a nice way
to treat a couple of splendid fellows like ourselves?&rdquo;
He threw out his chest and pulled himself
up to his full height, which was six feet
one.</p>
<p>Mary Louise gasped and looked conscience-stricken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We did forget!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;But we can
play now just as well as not&mdash;at least, if you&rsquo;ll
take us home to get our shoes and rackets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O.K.,&rdquo; agreed Max. He turned to Norman.
&ldquo;Get into the rumble, old man. I crave to have
Mary Louise beside me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The car started forward with its customary
sudden leap, and Max settled back in his seat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got some great news for you, Mary
Lou,&rdquo; he announced immediately. &ldquo;Big picnic
on for this coming Saturday! Rounding up the
whole crowd.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</div>
<p>Mary Louise was not impressed. Picnics
seemed tame to her in comparison with the excitement
of being a detective and hunting down
thieves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Afraid I have an engagement,&rdquo; she muttered.
She and Jane had a special arrangement,
by which every free hour of the day was pledged
to the other, so that if either wanted to get out
of an invitation, she could plead a previous date
without actually telling a lie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The heck you have!&rdquo; exclaimed Max, in disappointment.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to break it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sez you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah! Sez I. And you&rsquo;ll say so too, Mary
Lou, when you hear more about this picnic. It&rsquo;s
going to be different. We&rsquo;re driving across to
Cooper&rsquo;s woods&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ve been there,&rdquo; yawned Mary Louise.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing special there. Looks spooky
and deep, but it&rsquo;s just an ordinary woods. Maybe
a little wilder&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait! You women never let a fellow talk.
I&rsquo;ve been trying to tell you something for five
minutes, and here we are at your house, and you
haven&rsquo;t heard it yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess I shan&rsquo;t die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a light laugh she opened the car door
and leaped out, at the exact moment that Jane
and Norman jumped from the rumble, avoiding
a collision by a fraction of an inch.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me about it when I come out again,&rdquo;
called Mary Louise to Max as she and Jane ran
into their respective houses to change.</p>
<p>Freckles met Mary Louise at the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can I go with you, Sis?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, if you&rsquo;re ready,&rdquo; she agreed, making a
dash for the stairs. Her mother, meeting her in
the hall, tried to detain her.</p>
<p>She asked, &ldquo;Did the girl like the clothes,
dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, she loved them,&rdquo; replied Mary
Louise. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you more about it when I get
back from tennis. The boys are pestering us to
hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Three minutes later both she and Jane were
back in the car again, with Freckles and Silky
added to the passenger list.</p>
<p>Max immediately went on about the picnic,
just as if he hadn&rsquo;t been interrupted at
all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the big news,&rdquo; he said, as he stepped
on the starter: &ldquo;There are gypsies camping over
in that meadow beside Cooper&rsquo;s woods! So we&rsquo;re
all going to have our fortunes told. That&rsquo;s why
we&rsquo;re having the picnic there. Now, won&rsquo;t that
be fun?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I guess so. But I really don&rsquo;t see how
Jane and I can come&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">[62]</div>
<p>She was interrupted by a tap on her shoulder
from the rumble seat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we can break that date, Mary Lou,&rdquo;
announced her chum, with a wink.</p>
<p>Mary Louise raised her eyebrows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, of course, if Jane thinks so&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; she
said to Max.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s as good as settled,&rdquo; concluded Max, with
a chuckle.</p>
<p>But Mary Louise was not convinced until
she had a chance, after the game was over, to
talk to Jane alone and to ask her why she wanted
to go on the picnic when they had such important
things to do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I had an inspiration,&rdquo; replied Jane.
&ldquo;One of us can ask the gypsy to solve our crime
for us! They do tell strange things, sometimes,
you know&mdash;and they might lead us to the solution!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">[63]</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">CHAPTER V</span>
<br /><i>The Stolen Treasure</i></h2>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not just tired,&rdquo; announced Jane Patterson,
dropping into the hammock on Mary Louise&rsquo;s
porch after the tennis was over. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m completely
exhausted! I don&rsquo;t believe I can even move as
far as our house&mdash;let alone walk anywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, you can,&rdquo; replied Mary Louise.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll feel lots better after you get a shower
and some clean clothing. Four sets of tennis
oughtn&rsquo;t to do you up. Many a time I&rsquo;ve seen
you good for six.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, but they weren&rsquo;t so strenuous. Honestly,
you and Max ran me ragged. I tell you,
Mary Lou, I&rsquo;m all in. And I couldn&rsquo;t walk up
that hill to Miss Grant&rsquo;s house if it meant life
or death to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But think of poor Elsie! She may need us
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, what could we do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know yet. But we have to go to find
out just what was stolen, if for nothing else.
She may know by this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why not let the boys drive us up?&rdquo;
asked Jane, with a yawn.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">[64]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You know why. We can&rsquo;t let them into the
secret: they&rsquo;d tell everybody. And I bet, if the
thing got out, Miss Grant would be so mad she&rsquo;d
have Elsie arrested then and there. No, there&rsquo;s
nothing for us to do but walk.... So please
go get your shower.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wearily Jane struggled to her feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O.K. But I warn you, I may drop in my
tracks, and then you&rsquo;ll have to carry me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take a chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise met another protest from her
mother, who tried to insist that her daughter
lie down for a little rest before supper. But here
again persuasion won.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really, I&rsquo;m not tired, Mother,&rdquo; she explained.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only that I&rsquo;m hot and dirty. And
we have something very important to do&mdash;I
wish I could tell you all about it, but I can&rsquo;t
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her mother seemed satisfied. She had learned
by this time that she could trust Mary Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, dear,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Call Jane over,
and you may all have some lemonade. Freckles
said he had to have a cold drink.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">[65]</div>
<p>The refreshments revived even Jane, and half
an hour later the two girls were walking up the
shady lane which led towards the Grant place.
It wasn&rsquo;t so bad as Jane had expected; the road
was so sheltered by trees that they did not mind
the climb.</p>
<p>Once inside the hedge they peered eagerly in
among the cedar trees for a glimpse of Elsie.
But they did not see her anywhere.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s probably in the kitchen helping Hannah
with the dinner,&rdquo; concluded Mary Louise.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go around back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here they found her, sitting on the back step,
shelling peas. She was wearing her old dress
again, and the girls could see that she had been
crying. But her eyes lighted up with pleasure
at the sight of her two friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m so glad to see you girls!&rdquo; she cried.
&ldquo;I wanted you so much, and I didn&rsquo;t know how
to let you know. You see, I don&rsquo;t even have your
address&mdash;though that wouldn&rsquo;t have done me
much good, because I&rsquo;m not allowed out of the
gate, and I haven&rsquo;t any stamp to put on a letter.
The only thing I could do was pray that you
would come!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, here we are!&rdquo; announced Mary Louise,
with a significant look at Jane. &ldquo;Now tell us
why you specially wanted us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">[66]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wanted you to assure Aunt Mattie that
you really did give me those dresses and things.
Right away she said I must have bought them
with her money. Though how she thinks I
ever had a chance to get to any store is beyond
me. She knows I never leave this place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did she find out about them?&rdquo; inquired
Mary Louise. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t show them to her,
did you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t. She found them while she was
searching through my things this morning, to
see whether I had her money hidden anywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s terrible!&rdquo; exclaimed Jane. &ldquo;Oh, how
dreadful it must be to be all alone in the world,
without anybody who trusts you!&rdquo; Something of
the same thought ran through Mary Louise&rsquo;s
brain at the same time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell us just what has happened today, since
we left,&rdquo; urged Mary Louise. &ldquo;Has anybody
been here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Not a soul. But Aunt Mattie put me
through a lot more questions at lunch, and afterward
she gave my room a thorough search.
When she found my new clothes, she was more
sure than ever that I was the thief. She told me
if I didn&rsquo;t confess everything right away she&rsquo;d
have to change her mind and call the police.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did she call them?&rdquo; demanded Jane.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">[67]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet. It&rsquo;s lucky for me that she hasn&rsquo;t a
telephone. She said she guessed she&rsquo;d send William
after supper. So you can see how much it
meant to me for you girls to come over now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise nodded gravely, and Jane
blushed at her reluctance in wanting to come.
If Elsie had gone to jail, it would have been
their fault for giving her the clothing!</p>
<p>&ldquo;When can we see your aunt?&rdquo; inquired Mary
Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right now. I&rsquo;ll go in and tell her. She&rsquo;s
out on the front porch, I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elsie handed her pan to Hannah and went
through the kitchen to the front of the house.
She was back again in a moment, telling the
girls to come with her.</p>
<p>They found the old lady in her favorite rocking
chair, with her knitting in her lap. But she
was not working&mdash;just scowling at the world in
general, and when Elsie came out on the dilapidated
porch an expression of pain crossed her
wrinkled brows. Whether it was real pain from
that trouble in her side which she had mentioned,
or whether it was only a miserly grief
over the loss of her money, Mary Louise had
no way of telling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-afternoon, Miss Grant,&rdquo; she said pleasantly.
&ldquo;How is your kitten today?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A smile crept over the woman&rsquo;s face, making
her much more pleasant to look at.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">[68]</div>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s fine,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;Come here, Puffy,
and speak to the kind girls who rescued you
yesterday!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The kitten ran over and jumped into Miss
Grant&rsquo;s lap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She certainly is sweet,&rdquo; said Mary Louise.
She cleared her throat: why couldn&rsquo;t the old
lady help her out by asking her a question about
the clothing?</p>
<p>But Elsie, nervously impatient, brought up
the subject they were all waiting for.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell Aunt Mattie about the dresses and the
coat,&rdquo; she urged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; said Mary Louise hastily. &ldquo;Your
niece told us, Miss Grant, that she never gets
to Riverside to buy any new clothes, so when I
noticed we were all three about the same size,
Jane and I asked our mothers whether we
couldn&rsquo;t give her some of ours. They were willing,
and so we brought them over this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; was the only comment Miss Grant
made to this explanation. Mary Louise could
not tell whether she believed her or not and
whether she was pleased or angry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t mind, did you, Miss Grant?&rdquo; she
inquired nervously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">[69]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, of course not. Elsie&rsquo;s mighty lucky....
I only hope when she&rsquo;s working as somebody&rsquo;s
maid that they&rsquo;ll be as nice to her. It helps out,
when wages are small. For nobody wants to
pay servants much these days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A lump came into Mary Louise&rsquo;s throat at
the thought of Elsie&rsquo;s future, which Miss Grant
had just pictured for them. She longed to plead
the girl&rsquo;s cause, but she knew it would do no
good. Especially at the present time, with Miss
Grant poorer than she had ever been in her life.</p>
<p>The old lady&rsquo;s eyes suddenly narrowed, and
she looked sharply at Mary Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here!&rdquo; she said abruptly. &ldquo;You two girls
are the only people besides those living in this
house who know about this robbery, and I don&rsquo;t
want you to say a word of it to anybody! Understand?
I don&rsquo;t want the police in on this until
I am ready to tell them. Or my other relatives,
either. I expect to get that money back myself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>All three girls breathed a sigh of relief: it
was evident that the police would not be summoned
that evening. And both Mary Louise and
Jane gave their promise of utmost secrecy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we&rsquo;d like to help discover the thief, if
we can,&rdquo; added Mary Louise. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mind
if we try, do you, Miss Grant&mdash;if it&rsquo;s all on the
quiet?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">[70]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t mind. But I don&rsquo;t see what you
can do.&rdquo; Miss Grant looked sharply at Elsie, as
if she thought maybe her niece might confess
to these girls while she stubbornly refused to
tell her aunt anything. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;you
might succeed where I failed.... Yes, I&rsquo;ll pay
ten dollars&rsquo; reward if you get my money back
for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We think it might have been a robber,&rdquo; remarked
Mary Louise, to try to divert Miss
Grant&rsquo;s suspicious eyes from her niece. &ldquo;He
could have slipped in while you were at supper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t a robber,&rdquo; announced Miss Grant,
with conviction. &ldquo;If it had been, he&rsquo;d have taken
everything. The most valuable things were left
in the safe. My bonds. They&rsquo;re government
bonds, too, so anybody could see the value of
them&mdash;except a child! No, it was somebody
right in this house!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she laughed with that nasty cackle which
made Jane so angry, that, she said afterward,
if Miss Grant hadn&rsquo;t been an old lady, she
would have slapped her then and there in the
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or maybe it was one of your other relations,&rdquo;
said Mary Louise evenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly. I wouldn&rsquo;t trust Harry Grant or
Corinne Pearson. Or Corinne&rsquo;s mother, either,
for that matter!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about Mrs. Grant?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">[71]</div>
<p>&ldquo;My sister-in-law? No, I don&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;d
take anything. And I know it wasn&rsquo;t John&mdash;or
either of the servants.... No.&rdquo; She looked at
Elsie again. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s your culprit. Make her
confess&mdash;and you get ten dollars!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She paused, while everybody looked embarrassed.
But she was enjoying the situation. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
make it ten dollars apiece!&rdquo; she added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t the money we want, Miss Grant,&rdquo;
said Mary Louise stiffly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s to clear Elsie of
suspicion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense! Everybody wants money!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise took her notebook out of her
pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you tell us just how much money was
taken, Miss Grant?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;And&mdash;all about
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course I will. There was a metal box
in the safe with five hundred dollars in
gold&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gold!&rdquo; exclaimed Jane. &ldquo;I thought you were
supposed to turn that in to the government!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mind your business!&rdquo; snapped Miss
Grant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will&mdash;We will!&rdquo; said Mary Louise hastily.
&ldquo;Please go on, Miss Grant!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">[72]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Five hundred dollars in twenty-dollar gold
pieces,&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;Then there was eight
hundred and fifty dollars in bills&mdash;all in fifty-dollar
notes. I have the numbers of the bills
written down in a book upstairs. Would you
like to copy them down, Mary Louise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed!&rdquo; cried the latter rapturously.
Miss Grant was treating her just like a real detective!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come upstairs, then, with me, and you can
see the safe and my room at the same time.&rdquo; The
old lady turned to her niece, who was still
waiting nervously beside the door. &ldquo;Go back to
your work, Elsie,&rdquo; she commanded. &ldquo;Hannah
will be wanting you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl nodded obediently, but before she
disappeared she softly asked Mary Louise,
&ldquo;Will you and Jane be back again tomorrow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;You can
count on us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Grant gathered up her knitting and
picked up her kitten from the porch floor, where
it had been rolling about with a ball of its mistress&rsquo;s
wool.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may want you girls to walk over to the
bank with me tomorrow,&rdquo; she remarked. &ldquo;Unless
John happens to come here in his car. I&rsquo;ve
about decided to put my bonds into a safe-deposit
box at the bank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be glad to go with you,&rdquo; Mary Louise
assured her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">[73]</div>
<p>The old lady struggled painfully to her feet
and led the way through the house, up the stairs
to her room. Both girls noticed the ominous
creak which these gave when anything touched
them, and Jane shuddered. It must be awful to
live in a tumble-down place like this!</p>
<p>Miss Grant&rsquo;s room on the second floor was
at the front of the house, just as Elsie had said,
and one window overlooked the porch. It was
furnished with ugly, heavy wooden furniture,
and a rug that was almost threadbare. Along one
wall, opposite the bed, was a huge closet, in
which, no doubt, Miss Grant kept those old
dresses which she had offered to Corinne Pearson.
And the most astonishing thing about the
bedroom was the fact that it contained not a
single mirror!</p>
<p>(&ldquo;But, of course,&rdquo; Jane remarked afterward,
&ldquo;you wouldn&rsquo;t want to see yourself if you looked
like that old maid!&rdquo;)</p>
<p>Off in the corner was the iron safe, with the
only comfortable chair in the room beside it.
Here, evidently, Miss Grant spent most of her
time, rocking in the old-fashioned chair and
gloating over her money.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">[74]</div>
<p>Now she hobbled directly to the safe and
opened the door for the girls to look into it.
&ldquo;You can see how the lock has been picked,&rdquo;
she pointed out. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s broken now, of course.&rdquo;
She suddenly eyed the girls suspiciously, as if
they were not to be trusted either, and added,
&ldquo;The bonds aren&rsquo;t in there now! I hid them
somewhere else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise nodded solemnly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that was wise, Miss Grant.... Now,
may I write down the numbers of the bills that
were stolen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>After she had concluded this little task, she
went to examine the windows. They were both
large&mdash;plenty big enough for a person to step
through without any difficulty. But the one over
the porch proved disappointing, for the roof
of the porch was crumbling so badly and the
posts were so rotted that anyone who attempted
to climb in by that method would be taking his
life in his hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I always keep that window locked,&rdquo; said
Miss Grant, following Mary Louise. &ldquo;So you
see why I don&rsquo;t think it was a burglar who took
my money. Locked&mdash;day and night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise nodded and examined the other
window. It was high from the ground; there
was a tree growing near it, but not near enough
to make it possible for a human being to jump
from a branch to the window sill. Only a monkey
could perform a trick like that!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">[75]</div>
<p>Mary Louise turned away with a sigh. She was
almost ready to admit that the robbery was an
inside job, as Miss Grant insisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May we see inside the closet before we go?&rdquo;
she asked as an afterthought.</p>
<p>Miss Grant nodded and opened the door, disclosing
a space as large as the kitchenettes in
some of the modern apartments. Miss Grant herself
used it as a small storeroom for the things
that she did not want to put up in the attic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anybody could hide here for hours,&rdquo; Jane
remarked, &ldquo;without being suffocated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which is just what I believe Elsie did!&rdquo; returned
Miss Grant, with a smirk.</p>
<p>And the girls, unhappy and more baffled than
ever, went home to their suppers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">[76]</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small">CHAPTER VI</span>
<br /><i>A Wild Ride</i></h2>
<p>&ldquo;One of the best points in this case,&rdquo; Mary
Louise observed, in her most professional tone,
&ldquo;is its secrecy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you say that?&rdquo; questioned Jane.</p>
<p>The girls were returning from their second
visit that day to Dark Cedars and were walking
as fast as they could towards home. It was almost
six o&rsquo;clock, and Mary Louise usually
helped her mother a little with the supper. But
Freckles was there; she knew he would offer his
services.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I mean is, since the robbery hasn&rsquo;t been
talked about, nobody is on guard,&rdquo; she explained.
&ldquo;If any of those relatives did take the money,
probably they think the theft hasn&rsquo;t been discovered
yet, or Miss Grant would have called
them over to see her. In a way, it&rsquo;s pretty tricky
of her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, do you know, I can hardly believe any
of them stole all that gold,&rdquo; returned Jane. &ldquo;Because,
what would they do with it? Nobody is
supposed to use gold nowadays, and it would
arouse all sorts of suspicions.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">[77]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s true. But then, they might want
to hoard it, the same as Miss Grant did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A man like Harry Grant wouldn&rsquo;t want to
hoard any! From what I hear of him, he spends
money before he even gets it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True. But there are other relatives. And
somebody did steal it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, somebody stole it, all right. Only,
the fact that a lot of it was gold makes Elsie
look guilty. She probably wouldn&rsquo;t know about
the new law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise frowned: she didn&rsquo;t like that
thought. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m not going to suspect Elsie
till I&rsquo;ve investigated everybody else. Every one
of those five relations&mdash;Mrs. Grant, John Grant,
Harry Grant, Mrs. Pearson, and her daughter
Corinne!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you any plan at all?&rdquo; inquired Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;d like to do a little snooping tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Snooping? Where? How?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sneak around those two houses in Riverside&mdash;the
Grants&rsquo;, where John and Harry live with
their mother, and the Pearsons&rsquo;! It&rsquo;s such a warm
evening they&rsquo;ll probably be on their porches,
and we might overhear something to our advantage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But suppose we were arrested for prowling?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">[78]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, they wouldn&rsquo;t arrest two respectable-looking
girls like us! Besides, if they did, Daddy
could easily get us out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he isn&rsquo;t. But he&rsquo;ll be back in a day or
two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A day or two in the county jail wouldn&rsquo;t be so
good!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, Jane! Nothing will happen,&rdquo;
Mary Louise assured her. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to take
some chances if we&rsquo;re going to be detectives.
Daddy takes terrible ones sometimes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know where these people live?&rdquo; inquired
her chum. &ldquo;The Grants and the Pearsons,
I mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know where the Grants live: in that big
red brick house on Green Street. Old-fashioned,
set back from the street. Don&rsquo;t you remember?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I guess I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can pass it on our way home, if we go
one block farther down before we turn in at
our street.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about the Pearsons?&rdquo; asked Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where they live. But I think we
can get the address from the phone book.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">[79]</div>
<p>The girls stepped along at a rapid rate, entirely
forgetful of the tennis which had tired
Jane so completely a couple of hours ago. In a
minute or so they came in sight of the red brick
house. It was an ugly place, but it was not run
down or dilapidated like Miss Mattie Grant&rsquo;s.
John Grant evidently believed in keeping things
in repair.</p>
<p>The house stood next to a vacant lot, and it
was enclosed by a wooden fence, which was overgrown
with honeysuckle vines. A gravel drive
led from the front to the back yard, alongside
of this fence, and there were half a dozen large
old trees on the lawn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We could easily hide there after dark,&rdquo; muttered
Mary Louise. &ldquo;Climb over that fence back
by the garage and sneak up behind those trees
to a spot within hearing distance of the porch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see what good it would do us,&rdquo; objected
Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might do us lots of good! Look at that car!
That must be Harry Grant&rsquo;s, judging from Elsie&rsquo;s
description. If his car&rsquo;s there, he must be
home. And if we hear him say anything about
spending money, then we can be suspicious. Because,
where would he get the money unless he
stole his aunt&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane nodded her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I see your logic,&rdquo; she agreed. &ldquo;But there
isn&rsquo;t a soul around now, and likely as not there
won&rsquo;t be all evening.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">[80]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re probably eating supper. Come on,
let&rsquo;s hurry and get ours over. And meet me as
soon as you can afterwards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls separated at their gates, and Mary
Louise ran inside quickly to be on hand to help
her mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Daddy isn&rsquo;t home yet?&rdquo; she asked, as she carried
a plate of hot biscuits to the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, dear,&rdquo; answered her mother. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s in
Chicago&mdash;I had a special-delivery letter from
him today. He can&rsquo;t be back before the weekend&mdash;Saturday
or Sunday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise sighed. She had been hoping that
perhaps she could get some advice from him
without giving away any names or places.</p>
<p>Freckles dashed into the room, with Silky
close at his heels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where have you been, Sis?&rdquo; he demanded.
&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you take Silky with you? He&rsquo;s
been fussing for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jane and I had an errand to go,&rdquo; the girl
explained. &ldquo;And we couldn&rsquo;t take him along.
But we&rsquo;ll take him with us for a walk after supper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Walk again?&rdquo; repeated Mrs. Gay, her forehead
wrinkled in disapproval. &ldquo;Mary Louise,
you&rsquo;re doing too much! You must get some rest!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">[81]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We shan&rsquo;t be out long, Mother. It isn&rsquo;t a date
or anything. Jane and I want to take a little
stroll, with Silky, after supper. Isn&rsquo;t it all right
if I promise to go to bed very early?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose so. If you get in by nine-thirty&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I promise!&rdquo; replied Mary Louise, little
thinking how impossible it was going to be
for her to keep her word.</p>
<p>She did not start upon her project until she
had finished washing the dishes for her mother.
Then, slipping upstairs, she changed into a
dark green sweater dress and brown shoes and
stockings. Through the window of her bedroom
she signaled to her chum to make a similar
change.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might as well make ourselves as inconspicuous
as possible,&rdquo; she explained, as the two girls,
followed by Silky, walked down the street ten
minutes later. &ldquo;Did you have any trouble getting
away, Jane? I mean, without giving any
explanation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, a little. Mother can&rsquo;t understand all this
sudden passion for walking, when I used to
have to ride everywhere in Norman&rsquo;s or Max&rsquo;s
car. I really think she believes I have a new boy-friend
and that I meet him somewhere so as not
to make Norman jealous. As if I&rsquo;d go to all that
trouble!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise nodded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">[82]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A little jealousy does &rsquo;em good,&rdquo; she remarked.
&ldquo;Of course, Mother doesn&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s
so queer for me, because I always did have to
take Silky for walks. And he&rsquo;s a good excuse
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, we&rsquo;ll be home early tonight,&rdquo; concluded
Jane. &ldquo;So there won&rsquo;t be any cause for
worry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s somebody on the porch&mdash;several
people, I think,&rdquo; said Mary Louise as the girls
turned into the street on which the Grants&rsquo;
house was situated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two men,&rdquo; added Jane as they came nearer.
&ldquo;I think the person sitting down is a woman.
But it&rsquo;s getting too dark to see clearly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the better! That&rsquo;s just what we want.
Let&rsquo;s cut across the lot to the back of the place,
and sneak up behind the car in the driveway. We
can see the porch from there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m afraid we&rsquo;ll be caught,&rdquo; objected
Jane fearfully.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, she followed Mary Louise
around a side street to the rear of the lot, and together
they climbed the Grants&rsquo; fence, cautiously
and silently. Once inside, they crept noiselessly
along the grass near the fence until they came to
the back of Harry Grant&rsquo;s car.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">[83]</div>
<p>There could be no doubt that it was his. At
least five years old, with battered mudguards
and rusted trimmings, it looked like the relic
Elsie had laughed about. It was a small black
coup&eacute;, with a compartment behind for carrying
luggage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Mr. Harry Grant goes for a ride in this,
we&rsquo;re going with him!&rdquo; announced Mary Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; cried her chum. &ldquo;How could we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the luggage compartment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d smother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we wouldn&rsquo;t. We&rsquo;d open the lid after
we got started.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose he locked us in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He can&rsquo;t. I just made sure that the lock has
rusted off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what good would it do us to ride with
him?&rdquo; demanded Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sh! They might hear us!&rdquo; warned Mary
Louise. She turned to the dog and patted him.
&ldquo;You keep quiet too, Silky.... Why,&rdquo; she explained
in a whisper, &ldquo;we could watch to see
whether Mr. Harry spends any money. If he
brings out a fifty-dollar bill, he&rsquo;s a doomed
man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are clever, Mary Lou!&rdquo; breathed her
chum admiringly. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s an awful risk to
take.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no, it isn&rsquo;t. Mr. Grant isn&rsquo;t a gangster or
a desperate character. He wouldn&rsquo;t hurt us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">[84]</div>
<p>Jane looked doubtful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you made out who the people are on
the porch?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be Mrs. Grace Grant&mdash;and her two
sons. Yes, and I feel sure that is Harry, coming
down the steps now.... Listen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls&rsquo; eyes, more accustomed to the darkness,
could distinguish the figures quite plainly
by now. The younger of the two men, with a
satchel in his hand, was speaking to his mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ought to be back by Saturday,&rdquo; he said in
a loud, cheerful voice. &ldquo;And if this deal I&rsquo;ve
been talking about over in New York goes
through, I&rsquo;ll be driving home in a new car.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You better pay your debts first, Harry,&rdquo;
cautioned his mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope to make enough money to do both,&rdquo;
he returned confidently. &ldquo;And if you see Aunt
Mattie, you can tell her I don&rsquo;t need her help!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise nudged Jane&rsquo;s arm at this proud
boast and repressed a giggle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he can fool his mother,&rdquo; she whispered.
&ldquo;But he can&rsquo;t fool us! Come on, get in,
Jane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Holding open the lid of the car&rsquo;s compartment
she lifted Silky in and gave her hand to
her chum.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">[85]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose he puts his satchel in here,&rdquo; said
Jane, when they were all huddled down in the
extremely small space and Mary Louise had
cautiously let down the lid, shutting them in
absolute darkness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t&mdash;not if it has money in it. He&rsquo;ll
keep it right on the seat beside him.... He
will anyway, because it doesn&rsquo;t take up much
room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The car rocked to one side, indicating that
Harry Grant had stepped in and was seating
himself at the wheel. Jane&rsquo;s lip trembled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so dark in here! So terribly dark!
Where&rsquo;s your hand, Mary Lou?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&mdash;and here&rsquo;s Silky. Oh, Jane, this is
going to be good!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The motor started, and the car leaped forward
with a sudden uneven bound. Jane repressed
a cry of terror. It turned sharply at
the gate and buzzed along noisily for several
minutes before Mary Louise cautiously raised
the lid and looked out.</p>
<p>Oh, how good it was to see the lights again,
and the sky&mdash;after that horrible blackness!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">[86]</div>
<p>The car had reached the open highway which
led out of Riverside, and it picked up speed until
it was rattling along at a pace of about sixty
miles an hour. Growing bolder, Mary Louise
continued to raise the lid of the compartment
until it was upright at its full height. The girls
straightened up, with their heads and shoulders
sticking out of the enclosure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite a nice ride after all, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; observed
Mary Louise, gazing up at the stars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; returned Jane. &ldquo;It sounds
to me as if there were something wrong with
that engine. If we have an accident&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what I&rsquo;m hoping for,&rdquo; was the
surprising reply. &ldquo;Or rather, a breakdown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever would you do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you. Listen carefully, so we&rsquo;ll be
prepared to act the minute the car stops. While
Harry gets out on the left&mdash;he surely will, because
his wheel is on the left&mdash;we jump out on
the right. If there are woods beside the road,
as I remember there are for some distance along
here, we disappear into them. If not, we get to
the path, and just walk along as if we were two
people out for a walk with their dog. He won&rsquo;t
think anything about that, for he doesn&rsquo;t know
us, or know that we came with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how will that help us to find out whether
he is the thief?&rdquo; inquired Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My plan is to grab that satchel, if we get a
chance, and run off with it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s stealing, Mary Lou! He could
have us arrested.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">[87]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Detectives have to take chances like that. It
isn&rsquo;t really stealing, for we want to get hold of
it merely to give its contents to the rightful
owner. Of course, if there&rsquo;s no money in it, we
could return it later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were silent for a while, listening to the
pounding of the engine. Fifteen minutes passed;
Mary Louise saw by her watch when they rode
under a light that it was quarter after nine, and
she recalled her promise to her mother. But she
couldn&rsquo;t do anything about it now.</p>
<p>They were ascending a hill, and the speed of
the car was diminishing; it seemed to the girls
that they were not going to make it. The engine
wheezed and puffed, but the driver was evidently
doing his best. Ahead, on the left, shone
the lights of a gas station, and this, Mary Louise
decided, must be the goal that Harry was now
aiming for.</p>
<p>But the engine refused to go the full distance:
it sputtered and died, and the girls felt the car
jerked close to the right side, with no sign of
civilization about except the lighted gas station
about fifty yards ahead.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">[88]</div>
<p>But, lonely or not, the time had come for action,
and there was not a second to be lost. Before
Harry Grant&rsquo;s feet were off the running board
both girls were out of the car on the other side,
holding Silky close to them and hiding in the
shadow.</p>
<p>Mr. Grant stepped forward and raised the
hood of his motor, peering inside with a flashlight.
Keeping her eye on him through the
open window of the car, Mary Louise crept
cautiously along the right side towards the front.</p>
<p>The young man turned about suddenly and
swore softly to himself. But it was not because
he had seen or heard the girls, although Jane
did not wait to find that out. Desperately
frightened, she dashed wildly into the protecting
darkness of the bushes at the side of the
road.</p>
<p>Mary Louise, however, remained steadfastly
where she was, waiting for her opportunity.</p>
<p>It came in another moment. Lighting a cigarette,
Mr. Grant started to walk to the gas station.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What could be sweeter!&rdquo; exclaimed Mary
Louise rapturously to herself, for Jane was out
of hearing distance by this time. &ldquo;My big
chance!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">[89]</div>
<p>She reached her hand quickly through the
open window and picked up the satchel from
the seat. Then, with Silky close at her heels, she
too made for the protecting woods. In another
moment she was at Jane&rsquo;s side, breathless and
triumphant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re all right?&rdquo; demanded her chum exultantly.
&ldquo;Oh, Mary Lou, you&rsquo;re marvelous!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so marvelous as you think,&rdquo; replied the
other, feeling for Jane&rsquo;s hand in the darkness.
&ldquo;Lift that satchel!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane groped about, and took it from Mary
Louise, expecting a heavy weight.</p>
<p>But it was surprisingly, disappointingly light!</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t possibly contain any gold,&rdquo; said Mary
Louise, dropping to the ground in disgust. &ldquo;All
our trouble&mdash;and we&rsquo;re only a common pair of
thieves ourselves!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Silky came close to her and licked her hand
reassuringly, as if he did not agree with her
about the name she was calling herself and Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stranded on a lonely road&mdash;at least ten miles
from home!&rdquo; wailed Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sh!&rdquo; warned Mary Louise. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re at the
car&mdash;Harry and another man. We might be
caught!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But she stopped suddenly: something was
coming towards them, as they could sense from
the snapping of a twig close by. Not from the
road, however, but from the depth of the woods!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">[90]</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="small">CHAPTER VII</span>
<br />&ldquo;<i>Hands Up!</i>&rdquo;</h2>
<p>The two girls sat rigid with terror, Mary
Louise holding tightly to Silky. In the darkness
they could see nothing, for the denseness of the
trees blotted even the sky from view. The silence
of the woods was broken only by a faint rustle
in the undergrowth, as something&mdash;they didn&rsquo;t
know what&mdash;came nearer.</p>
<p>Silky&rsquo;s ears were alert, his body as tense with
watching, and Jane was actually trembling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got your flashlight, Mary Lou?&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but I&rsquo;m afraid to put it on till Harry
Grant gets away. He might see it from the
road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sudden roar of the motor almost drowned
out her words. The noise startled whatever it
was that was near them, and the girls felt a
little animal pass so close that it nearly touched
them. They almost laughed out loud at their
fear: the cause of their terror was only an innocent
little white rabbit!</p>
<p>Mary Louise took a tighter grip upon her dog.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">[91]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t leave us, Silky! You don&rsquo;t want
that bunny! We need you with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The engine continued to roar; the girls heard
the car start, and drive away. Jane uttered a
sigh of relief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder whether he missed his satchel,&rdquo; she
remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably he didn&rsquo;t care if he did,&rdquo; returned
her chum. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it has anything in it
but a toothbrush and a change of linen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s open it and see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise turned on her flashlight and
looked at the small brown bag beside them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shucks!&rdquo; she exclaimed in disappointment.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s locked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be. Well, so long as we have to
carry it home, maybe we&rsquo;ll be glad that it&rsquo;s so
light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got my penknife. I&rsquo;m going to cut the
leather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Mary Lou, it doesn&rsquo;t belong to us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t help that. We&rsquo;ll buy Harry Grant a
new one if he&rsquo;s innocent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O.K. You&rsquo;re the boss. Be careful not to cut
yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a id="rfront" href="#front">&ldquo;You hold the flashlight, Jane,&rdquo; said Mary Louise. &ldquo;While I make the slit.&rdquo;</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">[92]</div>
<p>The operation was not so easy, for the leather
was tough, but Mary Louise always kept her
knife as sharp as a boy&rsquo;s, and she succeeded at
last in making an opening.</p>
<p>Excitedly both girls peered into the bag, and
Jane reached her hand into its depths. She drew
it out again with an expression of disappointment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An old Turkish towel!&rdquo; she exclaimed in dismay.</p>
<p>But Mary Louise&rsquo;s search proved more fruitful.
Her hand came upon a bulky paper wad,
encircled by a rubber band. She drew her hand
out quickly and flashed the light upon her find.</p>
<p>It was a fat roll of money!</p>
<p>The girls gazed at her discovery in speechless
joy. It seemed more like a dream than reality:
one of those strange dreams where you find
money everywhere, in all sorts of queer, dark
places.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hide it in your sweater, Mary Lou!&rdquo; whispered
Jane. &ldquo;Now let&rsquo;s make tracks for home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her companion concealed it carefully and
then took another look into the satchel to make
sure that none of the gold was there. She even
inserted the flashlight into the bag, to confirm
her belief. But there was nothing more.</p>
<p>Both girls got to their feet, Jane with the satchel
still in her hands.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">[93]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wish we were home,&rdquo; she remarked after
the flashlight had been turned off, making the
darkness seem blacker than before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can pick up a bus along this road, I
think,&rdquo; returned Mary Louise reassuringly.
&ldquo;They ought to run along here about every
half hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we use some of this money for carfare?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we don&rsquo;t have to. I have my purse with
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Choosing their way carefully through the
bushes and undergrowth, the two girls proceeded
slowly towards the road. But their adventures
in the wood were not over. They heard
another rustle of twigs in front of them, and
footsteps. Human footsteps, this time!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hands up!&rdquo; snarled a gruff voice.</p>
<p>The reactions of the two girls and the dog
were instantaneous&mdash;and utterly different. Jane
clutched her chum&rsquo;s arm in terror; Mary Louise
flashed her light upon the man&mdash;a rough, uncouth
character, without even a mask&mdash;and
Silky flew at his legs. The dog&rsquo;s bite was quick
and sharp: the bully cried out in pain. Mary
Louise chuckled and, pulling Jane by the hand,
dashed out to the road, towards the lights of the
gas station in the distance. As the girls retreated,
they could hear groans and swearing from their
tormentor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">[94]</div>
<p>When they slowed down across the road from
the gas station, Mary Louise looked around and
whistled for Silky. Jane, noticing that she still
clutched the empty bag in her hand, hurled it as
far as she could in the direction from which they
had come.</p>
<p>In another moment the brave little dog came
bounding to them. Mary Louise stooped over
and picked him up in her arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wonderful Silky!&rdquo; she cried, as she led
the way across the road. &ldquo;You saved our lives!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose we hadn&rsquo;t taken him!&rdquo; said Jane in
horror. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d be dead now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go ask the attendant about buses,&rdquo; suggested
Mary Louise, still stroking her dog&rsquo;s
head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We better not!&rdquo; cautioned Jane. &ldquo;He may
suspect us, if Harry Grant told him about his
loss of the satchel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no, he won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; replied Mary Louise.
&ldquo;Because we&rsquo;ll tell him about the tramp, or the
bandit, or whatever he is&mdash;and he&rsquo;ll suspect
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They walked confidently up to the man inside
the station.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">[95]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re sort of lost,&rdquo; announced Mary Louise.
&ldquo;We want to get to Riverside. There was a tramp
back there about fifty yards who tried to make
trouble for us. Can we stay here until a bus
comes along&mdash;they do run along here, don&rsquo;t
they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, certainly,&rdquo; replied the man, answering
both questions at once. &ldquo;About fifty yards back,
you say? Did he have a brown satchel with
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw a brown satchel lying in the road,&rdquo; replied
Mary Louise innocently. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because a motorist stopped there a few minutes
ago with engine trouble, and while he came
to me for help his grip was stolen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did it have anything valuable in it?&rdquo; inquired
Jane, trying to keep her tone casual.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I believe there was about eight hundred
dollars in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise gasped in delight. That meant
that practically all of Miss Grant&rsquo;s paper money
was there&mdash;in her sweater! All but one fifty-dollar
bill!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I wouldn&rsquo;t go back there for eight
thousand dollars!&rdquo; said Jane.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">[96]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You can be sure there ain&rsquo;t any money in the
bag now,&rdquo; returned the attendant shrewdly.
&ldquo;Here comes your bus. You&rsquo;re lucky: they only
run every half hour.... I&rsquo;ll go stop it for
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise kept Silky in her arms, and the
two girls followed their protector to the middle
of the road. The bus stopped, and the driver
looked doubtfully at Silky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t allow no dogs,&rdquo; he announced firmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, please!&rdquo; begged Mary Louise in her
sweetest tone. &ldquo;Silky is such a good, brave dog!
He just saved our lives when we were held up
by a highwayman. And we have to get home&mdash;our
mothers will be so worried.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s agin&rsquo; the rules&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please let us this time! I&rsquo;ll hold him in my
lap.&rdquo; Her brown eyes looked into his; for a moment
the man thought Mary Louise was going
to cry. Then he turned to the half a dozen passengers
in his car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave it up to youse. Would any of youse
people report me if I let this here lady&rsquo;s dog in
the bus?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d report you if you didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; replied a
good-natured woman with gray hair. &ldquo;These
girls must get home as quickly as possible. It&rsquo;s
not safe for them to be out on a lonely road like
this at night.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">[97]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, thank you so much!&rdquo; exclaimed Mary
Louise, smiling radiantly at the kind woman.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so good of you to help us out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The door closed; the girls waved good-bye to
the attendant, and the bus started. Mary Louise
gazed dismally at her watch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even now we&rsquo;ll be an hour late,&rdquo; she remarked.
&ldquo;We promised our mothers we&rsquo;d be
home by half-past nine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Girls your age shouldn&rsquo;t go lonely places
after dark,&rdquo; observed the motherly woman. &ldquo;Let
this be a lesson to you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it will be, we assure you!&rdquo; Jane told her.
&ldquo;One experience like this is enough for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bus rumbled on for twenty minutes or so
and finally deposited the girls in Riverside, half
a block from their homes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still have the money?&rdquo; whispered Jane, as
they ran the short distance to their gates.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I can feel the wad here. I was so afraid
somebody in the bus would notice it. But having
Silky in my lap helped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems we have company,&rdquo; remarked Jane,
recognizing a familiar roadster parked in front
of their houses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now what can Max want at this time of
night?&rdquo; demanded Mary Louise impatiently.
She longed so terribly to get into her room by
herself and count the money.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">[98]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here they are, Mrs. Gay!&rdquo; called a masculine
voice from the porch. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re all right,
apparently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two mothers appeared on Mary Louise&rsquo;s
porch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What in the world happened?&rdquo; demanded
Mrs. Patterson. &ldquo;Mrs. Gay and I have been worried
to death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to mention us,&rdquo; added Norman Wilder
from the doorstep. &ldquo;We phoned all your friends,
and nobody had seen a thing of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish we could tell you all about it,&rdquo; answered
Mary Louise slowly. &ldquo;But we aren&rsquo;t allowed
to. All I can say is, it&rsquo;s something in connection
with Elsie Grant&mdash;the orphan, you
know, Mother, whom we told you about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Gay looked relieved but not entirely satisfied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t have you two girls going up that
lonely road at night, dear,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;To the
Grants&rsquo; place, I mean. It isn&rsquo;t safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we weren&rsquo;t there tonight,&rdquo; Jane assured
her, not going on to explain that they had gone
somewhere far more dangerous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you do have to go there, let Max or
Norman drive you,&rdquo; suggested Mrs. Patterson.
&ldquo;The boys are willing, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure thing!&rdquo; they both replied.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">[99]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s all come inside and have some chocolate
cake,&rdquo; said Mrs. Gay, delighted that everything
had turned out all right. &ldquo;You girls must
be hungry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were, of course; but Mary Louise was
more anxious to be alone to count her treasure
than to eat. However, she could not refuse, and
the party lasted until after eleven.</p>
<p>Her mother followed her upstairs after the
company had gone home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must be tired, dear,&rdquo; she said tenderly.
&ldquo;Just step out of your clothes, and I&rsquo;ll hang them
up for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, thanks, Mother. I&rsquo;m not so tired. We
rode home in the bus.... Please don&rsquo;t bother.
I&rsquo;m all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as you say, dear,&rdquo; agreed Mrs. Gay, kissing
her daughter good-night. &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t get up
for breakfast. Try to get some sleep!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise smiled.</p>
<p>(&ldquo;Not if I know it,&rdquo; she thought to herself.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going after the rest of that treasure! The
gold! Maybe if I get that back for Miss Grant,
she&rsquo;ll consent to let Elsie go to high school in the
fall.&rdquo;)</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</div>
<p>Very carefully she drew off her sweater and
laid the bills under the pillow on her bed. Then,
while she ran the shower in the bathroom, behind
a locked door, she counted the money and
checked the numbers engraved on the paper.</p>
<p>The attendant was right! There were eight
hundred dollars in all, in fifty-dollar notes. And
the best part about it was the fact that the numbers
proved that the money belonged to Miss
Mattie Grant!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="small">CHAPTER VIII</span>
<br /><i>A Confession</i></h2>
<p>It was a little after nine o&rsquo;clock the following
morning that Mary Louise and Jane set off for
Dark Cedars. The money was safely hidden in
Mary Louise&rsquo;s blouse, and Silky was told to
come along for protection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never leave him home again,&rdquo; said Mary
Louise. &ldquo;Miss Grant will have to get used to
him. But when we tell her about last night I
guess she&rsquo;ll think he&rsquo;s a pretty wonderful dog.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dreamed about bandits and robbers,&rdquo; remarked
Jane, with a shudder. &ldquo;No more night
adventures for me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it was worth it, wasn&rsquo;t it? Think of the
pleasure of clearing Elsie of suspicion!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t, though. Her aunt will insist that
she took that gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to get that back too,&rdquo; asserted
Mary Louise confidently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; observed Jane, &ldquo;Norman tried
to make me promise we&rsquo;d drive over to the Park
with them this afternoon and have our supper
there, after a swim. I said I&rsquo;d let him know.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</div>
<p>Mary Louise shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t make dates, Jane. It&rsquo;s out of the
question, for we don&rsquo;t know what may turn up.
I want to investigate the Pearsons today. That
disagreeable Corinne may have had a part in the
theft.... I&rsquo;m sorry now that we promised the
boys we&rsquo;d go on that picnic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That picnic&rsquo;s going to be fun! You know
what marvelous swimming there is down by
Cooper&rsquo;s woods. And don&rsquo;t forget the gypsies!
I love to have my fortune told.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s fun, I admit. But a whole
day&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, maybe we&rsquo;ll solve the whole crime
today! And maybe Miss Grant will let us take
Elsie with us, now that she has some nice
dresses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise&rsquo;s eyes brightened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is an idea, Jane. I&rsquo;ll ask Miss Grant
today&mdash;as our reward for returning her money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The increasing heat of the day and the steepness
of the climb to Dark Cedars made the girls
long for that swimming pool in the amusement
park, and Jane at least wished that they were
going with the boys. But one glance at her
chum&rsquo;s determined face made her realize that
such a hope was not to be fulfilled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</div>
<p>Both girls felt hot and sticky when they finally
mounted the porch steps at Dark Cedars and
pulled the old-fashioned knocker on the wooden
door. It was opened almost immediately by Hannah,
who evidently had been working right there
in the front of the house.</p>
<p>The woman looked hot and disturbed, as if
she had been working fast, under pressure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-morning,&rdquo; said Mary Louise brightly.
&ldquo;May we see Miss Grant, Hannah?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; replied the servant. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s all
of a fluster. We&rsquo;re at sixes and sevens here this
mornin&rsquo;. The ghosts walked last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What ghosts?&rdquo; asked Mary Louise, trying to
repress a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know. Elsie&rsquo;s told you about &rsquo;em. The
spirits that wanders through this house at night,
mussin&rsquo; up things. They had a party all over the
downstairs last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hannah!&rdquo; exclaimed Jane. &ldquo;You know that
isn&rsquo;t possible. If there was a disturbance, it was
caused by human beings. Burglars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know nuthin&rsquo; about it! If it was
burglars, why wasn&rsquo;t somethin&rsquo; stolen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t anything stolen?&rdquo; demanded Mary
Louise incredulously. &ldquo;Not Miss Grant&rsquo;s
bonds?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nope. They&rsquo;re all there&mdash;safe. Pictures was
taken down&mdash;old pictures that must-a belonged
to the spirits when they was alive. That old desk
in the corner of the dinin&rsquo; room&mdash;the one that
belonged to Miss Mattie&rsquo;s father&mdash;was rummaged
through, and all the closets was upset.
But nuthin&rsquo;s missin&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks as if somebody were searching for
a will,&rdquo; remarked Jane. &ldquo;You know&mdash;&lsquo;the lost
will&rsquo; you so often read about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t no will in this house,&rdquo; Hannah
stated. &ldquo;Miss Mattie give hers to Mr. John
Grant to keep, long ago. No, ma&rsquo;am, it ain&rsquo;t nateral
what&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; on here, and William and I are
movin&rsquo; out&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this? What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; interrupted the
shrill, high voice of the old lady. &ldquo;What are you
gossiping about, Hannah? And to whom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just tellin&rsquo; them two young girls&mdash;the
ones that come here before, you know&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, never mind!&rdquo; snapped the spinster.
&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t time to bother with them this
morning. Tell them to run along and not to
take up Elsie&rsquo;s time, either. She&rsquo;s got plenty to
do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane laughed sarcastically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody ought to teach that woman manners,&rdquo;
she whispered to Mary Louise. &ldquo;Serve her
right if we didn&rsquo;t give her the money!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">[105]</div>
<p>Her chum smiled. &ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t be so cruel,&rdquo;
she replied. &ldquo;Besides, it wouldn&rsquo;t be honest.&rdquo;
She raised her voice. &ldquo;Miss Grant, we have some
money for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Money? My money?&rdquo; The old lady&rsquo;s voice
was as eager as a child&rsquo;s. For the moment she
forgot all about the pain in her side and came
downstairs more rapidly than she had done for
many a day.</p>
<p>Both girls watched her in surprise. She looked
different today&mdash;much younger. Instead of the
somber old black sateen which she usually wore,
she was dressed in a gray gown of soft, summery
material, and her cheeks were flushed a pale
pink. Her black eyes were alight with vivacity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not fooling me?&rdquo; she demanded fearfully.</p>
<p>Mary Louise reached into her blouse and produced
the roll of bills.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Miss Grant. We have eight hundred dollars
here&mdash;your money! The numbers on the bills
correspond to the figures you gave me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the other fifty?&rdquo; asked the woman
greedily. &ldquo;Did you keep it yourselves?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, of course not. We don&rsquo;t know where it
is. But if you sit down, Miss Grant, we&rsquo;ll tell you
our story.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">[106]</div>
<p>The spinster reached out her hand for the roll
of money and clasped it as lovingly as a mother
might fondle her lost child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come into the parlor,&rdquo; she said, leading the
way from the hall, &ldquo;and tell me all about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls followed her into the ugly room with
its old-fashioned furniture, and saw for themselves
the chaos which Hannah had been describing.
Instinctively Mary Louise glanced at the
windows to determine how an intruder could
enter, for she did not believe Hannah&rsquo;s story of
the ghosts. Although the shutters were half
closed, she could see that the catch on the side
window had been broken. But everything in this
house was so dilapidated that perhaps no one had
noticed it.</p>
<p>When they were all seated, Jane told the story
of the previous evening&rsquo;s adventure, stressing the
part that Silky had played at the end. Miss
Grant was impressed and actually asked to see
the wonderful little dog. Mary Louise replied
that he was waiting for them on the porch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it was Harry Grant after all!&rdquo; the old
lady muttered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not surprised. But I still
believe Elsie had some part in it&mdash;and got the
gold pieces for herself. She&rsquo;d rather have them
than the paper money.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no, Miss Grant!&rdquo; protested Mary Louise.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to track them down too. We want
to go over to Harry Grant&rsquo;s now, if you&rsquo;ll write
us a note of introduction and explanation. He
may have the gold at his house&mdash;it isn&rsquo;t likely
that he&rsquo;d carry it around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly. But I don&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;ll write a note&mdash;I
think I&rsquo;ll go along with you! I want to talk
to that good-for-nothing nephew of mine myself&mdash;if
he&rsquo;s home. And he probably is, since you got
the money.... Yes, and I&rsquo;m going to put this
money and my bonds in the bank!&rdquo; She hesitated
a moment. &ldquo;If you girls get me back that other
fifty-dollar bill, I&rsquo;ll give you a reward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want a reward, Miss Grant,&rdquo; objected
Mary Louise. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll just let us take
Elsie with us to a picnic the young people in
Riverside are planning, we&rsquo;ll be satisfied.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll think about it,&rdquo; replied the woman.
&ldquo;Hannah!&rdquo; she called. &ldquo;You go up and get my
bonnet, and a brown paper package that&rsquo;s underneath
it in the box. I&rsquo;m going to Riverside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t a-goin&rsquo; a walk, Miss Mattie?&rdquo; demanded
the servant in horror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I am. I haven&rsquo;t any car. John may
not be over for several days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But your side&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fiddlesticks! Do as you&rsquo;re told, Hannah.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</div>
<p>The girls hated to leave without seeing Elsie,
but they knew that Hannah would tell her what
had happened. Besides, they would probably return
with Miss Grant; perhaps they could get
Norman or Max to drive them over. Jane
chuckled at the idea of putting the old lady in
the rumble seat&mdash;just for spite!</p>
<p>Silky came darting up to them as they came
out of the door, and Miss Grant reached over
and patted his head. (&ldquo;It&rsquo;s her one redeeming
trait,&rdquo; thought Mary Louise&mdash;&ldquo;her kindness to
animals.&rdquo;)</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you brought him,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;in case
we meet anybody like that man you encountered
last night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They proceeded slowly, although the road was
downhill; every few minutes Miss Grant
stopped and held her hand over her side. Mary
Louise wondered what they would do if the old
lady collapsed, and decided that Jane would
have to run for a doctor while she and Silky
stayed to protect her and administer first aid.</p>
<p>But they reached the Riverside bank without
any such mishap, and Miss Grant attended to
her business while the girls waited outside. Then,
very slowly, they walked the three blocks to the
home of Harry Grant.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He is back!&rdquo; exclaimed Mary Louise jubilantly
as she recognized the battered old car in
the driveway. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t expect he would be. I
thought he&rsquo;d stay away as long as that fifty-dollar
bill lasted him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he didn&rsquo;t have it,&rdquo; remarked Miss
Grant.</p>
<p>Jane turned on her angrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think we kept that, don&rsquo;t you, Miss
Grant?&rdquo; she demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no! Nothing of the kind!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before they had mounted the porch steps,
Mrs. Grace Grant had rushed out of her house
in amazement and stood gazing at her sister-in-law
as if she were a ghost. She was a woman
of about the same age, but much pleasanter looking,
with soft gray hair and a sweet smile. As
Elsie had said, nobody could believe anything
bad about Mrs. Grace Grant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Mattie, this is a surprise!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been five years at least&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be more of a surprise when I tell you
why I&rsquo;m here, Grace,&rdquo; snapped the other, sinking
into a chair on the porch with a sigh of relief.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got bad news. I&rsquo;ve been robbed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Robbed?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">[110]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; In a few words the spinster told the
story of her loss of thirteen hundred and fifty
dollars, and of the two girls&rsquo; offer of assistance
in discovering the thief. &ldquo;Of course, I suspected
Elsie immediately,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but it seems I
made a mistake. Or partly a mistake, for there is
still five hundred missing&mdash;all in gold. But these
girls found out who took the bills and have got
them all back for me&mdash;all but fifty dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was the thief?&rdquo; demanded Mrs. Grant
excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Your son Harry!</i> I&rsquo;m sorry to have to tell you
this, Grace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it!&rdquo; protested the other
woman. &ldquo;What proof have you, Mattie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell the story, Jane,&rdquo; said Miss Grant. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
too tired.&rdquo; She leaned against the back of her
chair in exhaustion.</p>
<p>Briefly Jane related the incidents of the previous
evening, describing their perilous ride in
Harry Grant&rsquo;s car. The story rang true; Jane repeated
the very words the young man had uttered
as he drove away, words which Mrs. Grant
recalled easily. Before she had finished, the unhappy
mother was crying softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do to him, Mattie?&rdquo;
she asked finally. &ldquo;Have him arrested?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That depends on him,&rdquo; replied her visitor.
&ldquo;If he gives me back the other bill, maybe I&rsquo;ll
let him go. I don&rsquo;t want to drag the Grant name
into the papers if I can help it.... Is he
home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. He&rsquo;s upstairs, dressing.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">[111]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Just getting up, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was out late last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carousing with my fifty dollars, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope not.&rdquo; Mrs. Grant rose and went
through the screen door. Five minutes later she
returned with her son.</p>
<p>As Elsie had remarked, Harry Grant was a
good-looking man. He was stylishly dressed, in
an immaculate linen suit, and he came out smiling
nonchalantly at his aunt, as if the whole thing
were a joke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll be darned!&rdquo; he exclaimed, staring
incredulously at Mary Louise and Jane. &ldquo;Are
these the girls Mother says I took for a ride last
night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a terrible car,&rdquo; remarked Jane.</p>
<p>Miss Grant stamped her foot to put a stop to
what she considered nonsensical talk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me just how you managed to steal my
money, Harry,&rdquo; she commanded. &ldquo;And where
the other fifty-dollar bill is&mdash;and my five hundred
in gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man&rsquo;s chin went up in the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t steal your money, Aunt Mattie,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;I was never inside your bedroom in my
life&mdash;at least, not since I was grown up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t lie, Harry! How did you get it if you
didn&rsquo;t steal it out of my safe?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It was given to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By whom?&rdquo; Miss Grant looked scornful: she
couldn&rsquo;t believe any such foolish statement.</p>
<p>The young man hesitated. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I
ought to tell that,&rdquo; he replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, you ought! And you have to, or I&rsquo;ll
have you arrested,&rdquo; threatened his aunt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell the truth, dear,&rdquo; urged his mother.
&ldquo;Whoever stole that money deserves to suffer for
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right&mdash;I will! It was Corinne&mdash;my niece,
Corinne Pearson. She took it. Eight hundred and
fifty dollars in bills. She gave me eight hundred
dollars&mdash;half of it to spend for her, and half for
myself. I was to buy a certain evening gown and
cloak in a shop in New York with which she
had been corresponding. With my four hundred
I was going to get a new car and drive back to
Riverside and announce that I had a present for
Corinne, because I was sorry for her about the
party, and because I had put a good sale through.
That&rsquo;s all.... It simply didn&rsquo;t work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Corinne!&rdquo; repeated Miss Grant. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not
surprised. I always did suspect her.... And
has she the other fifty dollars?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I believe she kept that for slippers and
the beauty parlor,&rdquo; answered Harry.</p>
<p>Miss Grant got up from her chair.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">[113]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You surely haven&rsquo;t any of the gold, have you,
Harry?&rdquo; she inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Corinne didn&rsquo;t say anything about any
gold pieces. You can&rsquo;t use them now, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt she&rsquo;s keeping them put away,&rdquo; surmised
the old lady. &ldquo;Come, girls! We&rsquo;re going
to the Pearsons&rsquo; now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can I drive you over, Aunt Mattie?&rdquo; offered
Harry jovially.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t put a foot in that rattletrap for
anything in the world!&rdquo; was his aunt&rsquo;s ungracious
retort.</p>
<p>So she hobbled down the steps with Mary
Louise and Jane beside her and Silky close at
their heels.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">[114]</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="small">CHAPTER IX</span>
<br /><i>The Fifty-Dollar Bill</i></h2>
<p>The Pearsons&rsquo; home, an attractive house of the
English cottage type, was half a mile from Mrs.
Grant&rsquo;s, in the best residential section of Riverside.
Mary Louise, noticing Miss Grant&rsquo;s increasing
weakness, suggested a taxicab.</p>
<p>The old lady scorned such a proposal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Use your common sense, Mary Louise!&rdquo; she
commanded, in that brusque manner which Jane
so resented. &ldquo;You know I&rsquo;ve lost five hundred
and fifty dollars, and now you suggest that I
throw money away on luxuries like taxicabs!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pay for it,&rdquo; offered the girl. &ldquo;I have my
purse with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fiddlesticks!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hot sun of the June day poured mercilessly
down upon their heads as they made their
slow progress along the streets of Riverside, but
Miss Grant refused to give up, although it was
evident that she was suffering intensely. When
they finally reached the porch of the Pearson
home she almost collapsed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">[115]</div>
<p>Corinne Pearson was sitting in the swing, idly
smoking a cigarette when the little party arrived.
She was a blonde, about nineteen years of
age, pretty in an artificial way. Even her pose,
alone on the porch, was theatrical. She rose
languidly as her great-aunt came up the steps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother&rsquo;s inside, Aunt Mattie,&rdquo; she said, ignoring
the two girls completely. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go and tell
her that you are here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Grant opened her eyes wide and looked
sharply at Corinne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t trouble yourself!&rdquo; she snapped, gasping
for breath. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s <i>you</i> I came to see, Corinne
Pearson!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl raised her delicately arched eyebrows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really? Well, I am honored, Aunt Mattie.&rdquo;
There was nothing in her manner to indicate
nervousness, and Mary Louise began to wonder
whether Harry Grant&rsquo;s story were really true.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t be when I tell you why I&rsquo;m here!
Though of course you can guess.&rdquo; Miss Grant
paused and took a deep breath. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about that
money you stole from my safe!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What money?&rdquo; The girl&rsquo;s indifference was
admirable, if indeed she were guilty, as Harry
Grant claimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know. Eight hundred and fifty dollars
in bills and five hundred in gold pieces.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">[116]</div>
<p>Corinne laughed in a nasty superior way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really, Aunt Mattie, you are talking foolishly.
I&rsquo;m sorry if you have been robbed, but it&rsquo;s
just too absurd to connect me with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop your posing and lying, Corinne Pearson!&rdquo;
cried the old lady in a shrill voice. &ldquo;I
know all about everything. Harry Grant has
confessed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise, watching the girl&rsquo;s face intently,
thought that she saw her wince. Anyway,
the cigarette she was smoking dropped to the
floor. But her voice sounded controlled as she
spoke to her great-aunt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t scream like that, Aunt Mattie,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;The neighbors will hear you. I think
you had better come inside and see Mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; agreed the old lady. Then, turning
to the girls, she requested them to help her
get to her feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll help you,&rdquo; offered Corinne. &ldquo;These
young girls can wait out here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, they can&rsquo;t, either! They&rsquo;re coming right
inside with me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Corinne shrugged her slim shoulders and
opened the screen door. Her mother, a stout
woman of perhaps forty-five, was standing in the
living room, which opened directly on the porch.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">[117]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Aunt Mattie!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;This
is a surprise. You must be feeling better&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a lot worse!&rdquo; interrupted the old lady,
sinking into a chair beside the door. &ldquo;Your
daughter&rsquo;s the cause of it, too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My daughter? How could Corinne be the
cause of your bad health, Aunt Mattie? You&rsquo;re
talking foolishly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t speak to me like that, Ellen Grant
Pearson! Your daughter Corinne&rsquo;s a thief&mdash;and
she stole my money, out of my safe. Night before
last, when she went upstairs to get that old
lace dress of mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; protested Mrs. Pearson. &ldquo;You
didn&rsquo;t, did you, Corinne?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; replied the girl. &ldquo;I think
Aunt Mattie&rsquo;s mind is wandering, Mother. Send
these girls home, and I&rsquo;ll call up Uncle John.
He&rsquo;ll come and drive Aunt Mattie back to Dark
Cedars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll do nothing of the kind!&rdquo; announced
Miss Grant. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s not a thing the matter with
my mind&mdash;it&rsquo;s my side and my breathing.&rdquo; She
turned to her two young friends. &ldquo;Jane, you tell
them all about everything that has happened
since I was robbed.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">[118]</div>
<p>Jane nodded and again related the story, telling
of their wild ride in Harry Grant&rsquo;s car, the
capture of the satchel with the bills in it, and
concluding with Harry&rsquo;s confession concerning
Corinne&rsquo;s part in the crime. Mrs. Pearson
leaned forward in her chair, listening to the recital
with serious attention, but her daughter
acted as if she were bored with such nonsense
and wandered about the room while Jane was
talking, rearranging the flowers on the tables
and lighting herself a fresh cigarette.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t true, is it, dear?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Pearson
eagerly.</p>
<p>Corinne laughed scornfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just too absurd to contradict,&rdquo; she replied.
&ldquo;Uncle Harry made it all up about me
just to save his own face.&rdquo; She turned about and
faced her great-aunt. &ldquo;You know yourself, Aunt
Mattie, that if I had stolen that money I
wouldn&rsquo;t pay him four hundred dollars just to
buy me some clothes in New York. It&rsquo;s all out
of proportion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Grant nodded: she could see the sense to
that. A hundred dollars would have been ample
commission.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I say something?&rdquo; put in Mary Louise
meekly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; replied Miss Grant.</p>
<p>The girl felt herself trembling as all eyes in
the room turned upon her. But she spoke out
bravely, disregarding Corinne&rsquo;s open scorn.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">[119]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I believe I can explain why Miss Pearson
divided the money evenly with Mr. Harry
Grant,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It was a clever trick, to throw
the suspicion on him. Because you know, Miss
Grant, if you saw him drive home with a new
car, wouldn&rsquo;t you naturally jump to the conclusion
that he had bought it with your money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old lady nodded her head: the idea
sounded reasonable to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And as for Miss Pearson&rsquo;s evening dress and
cloak,&rdquo; continued Mary Louise, &ldquo;if she didn&rsquo;t
buy them in Riverside, you&rsquo;d probably never
know what she paid for them, or suspect them of
being particularly expensive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true, Mary Louise,&rdquo; agreed Miss
Grant. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d never dream anybody would spend
four hundred dollars for two pieces of finery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Exasperated with the discussion, Corinne
Pearson started towards the stairway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to listen to any more of this
ridiculous babble!&rdquo; she said to her mother, with
a scathing glance towards Mary Louise. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
have to excuse me, Aunt Mattie,&rdquo; she added condescendingly.
&ldquo;I have a date.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You stay right here!&rdquo; commanded the old
lady. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not through with you. You hand over
that other fifty-dollar bill!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</div>
<p>Corinne shrugged her shoulders and looked
imploringly at her mother, as if to say, &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t
something be done with that crazy woman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Pearson looked helpless: she didn&rsquo;t know
how to get rid of her aunt.</p>
<p>The situation was apparently at a standstill.
Corinne Pearson wouldn&rsquo;t admit any part in the
theft, and Miss Grant refused to allow her to go
off as if she were innocent. But Mary Louise, recalling
Harry Grant&rsquo;s explanation of the use to
which Corinne had put that last fifty-dollar bill,
had a sudden inspiration. She stood up and faced
Mrs. Pearson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I use your telephone?&rdquo; she asked
quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes, certainly,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;Right
there on the table.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again all eyes in the room were turned upon
Mary Louise as she searched through the telephone
book and gave a number to the operator.
Everybody waited, in absolute silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; said Mary Louise when the connection
was made. &ldquo;Is this the Bon Ton Boot Shop?
Yes? Can you tell me whether you took in a fifty-dollar
bill yesterday from any of your customers?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</div>
<p>It seemed to her that she could actually feel
the tenseness of the atmosphere in that room in
the Pearsons&rsquo; house while she waited for the
shop girl to return with the information she had
asked for. Her eyes turned towards Corinne to
see how the question had affected her, but Mary
Louise could not see her face from where she
was seated. In another moment the voice at the
other end of the wire summoned her thoughts
back to the phone. And the answer was in the
affirmative!</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you did take in a fifty-dollar bill?&rdquo; Mary
Louise repeated for the benefit of her listeners.
&ldquo;Could you possibly read me the number engraved
on it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her hand trembled as she fumbled for her
little notebook in which the notations were made,
and Jane, guessing her intention, dashed across
the room to assist her. When the salesgirl finally
read out the number on the bill, Mary Louise
was able to check it with the one marked &ldquo;missing.&rdquo;
It was the identical bill!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you keep it out of the bank for an hour
or two&mdash;in case we want to identify it&mdash;for a certain
purpose?&rdquo; she inquired. &ldquo;My name is Mary
Louise Gay&mdash;Detective Gay&rsquo;s daughter....
Oh, thank you so much!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">[122]</div>
<p>She replaced the receiver and jumped up
from the chair, squeezing Jane&rsquo;s arm in delight.
She noticed that Miss Grant&rsquo;s black eyes were
beaming upon her with admiration and that
Mrs. Pearson&rsquo;s were shifting uneasily about the
room. Corinne was standing at the window with
her back to the other people.</p>
<p>Suddenly she burst into hysterical sobs.
Wheeling about sharply, she turned on Mary
Louise like a cat that is ready to spit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You horrible girl!&rdquo; she screamed. &ldquo;You
nasty, vile creature! What right have you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush, Corinne!&rdquo; admonished Miss Grant.
&ldquo;Be quiet, or I&rsquo;ll send you somewhere where you
will be! Dry your eyes and sit down there in that
chair and tell us the truth. And throw that cigarette
away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frightened by her great-aunt&rsquo;s threat, the girl
did as she was told.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you won&rsquo;t believe me now when I
tell you that I didn&rsquo;t take any gold pieces,&rdquo; she
whined. &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s the solemn truth. I admit
about the bills&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Begin at the beginning,&rdquo; snapped Miss
Grant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. It was night before last, when
Mother and I walked over to ask you for money
for a dress. It means so much to me to look nice
at the dance on Saturday night&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care what it means to you,&rdquo; interrupted
the spinster. &ldquo;Go ahead with your story.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I thought it was pretty stingy of you
not to help me out, Aunt Mattie,&rdquo; continued
Corinne. &ldquo;But I never thought of taking the
money till I went up in your room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you get the safe open?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the queer part. <i>It was open!</i> I thought
you had forgotten to close the door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Grant gasped in horror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never forget. Besides, I saw that the lock
had been picked. Somebody did break it, if you
didn&rsquo;t, Corinne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There wasn&rsquo;t a bit of gold there, Aunt Mattie.
I&rsquo;m willing to swear to that!&rdquo; Corinne looked
straight into the old lady&rsquo;s black eyes, and Mary
Louise could see that her aunt believed her and
was already trying to figure out who else was
guilty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you didn&rsquo;t have time to fiddle with a
lock,&rdquo; she agreed. &ldquo;I can believe that.... I
think I was right in the beginning: Elsie must
have stolen the box of gold pieces.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course!&rdquo; cried Corinne in relief. &ldquo;That
would explain it perfectly. An ignorant child
like her would want only the gold&mdash;that&rsquo;s why
the paper money and the bonds were untouched.
Did you lose the bonds too, Aunt Mattie?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">[124]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, they were still there. I put them in the
bank today, with the eight hundred dollars these
girls got from Harry Grant.... Well, Corinne,
you did give your uncle Harry that money
then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I did. For the exact purpose he told you
about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise sighed. They were right back
where they started, with only this difference:
that while Elsie had been suspected of the theft
of the whole amount in the beginning, now she
was thought to be guilty of stealing only the
gold. But stealing is stealing, no matter what the
amount, and Mary Louise was unhappy.</p>
<p>Miss Grant grasped hold of the arms of her
chair and struggled to her feet. She stood there
motionless for a moment, holding her hand on
her side. The flush on her cheeks had disappeared;
her face was now deathly white. Both
girls knew that she could never make that climb
in the heat to Dark Cedars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t do anything to Corinne, will you,
Aunt Mattie?&rdquo; pleaded Mrs. Pearson fearfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;I guess not. Go get me&mdash;&rdquo; Mary Louise
expected her to ask for aromatics, to prevent a
fainting fit, but she was mistaken&mdash;&ldquo;go get me&mdash;my
fifty dollars&mdash;what you have left of it, Corinne.
You can owe&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">[125]</div>
<p>But she could not complete her sentence: she
reeled, and would have fallen to the floor had
not Mary Louise sprung to her side at that very
second. As it was, Miss Grant fainted in the
girl&rsquo;s arms.</p>
<p>Very gently Mary Louise laid her down on
the davenport and turned to Mrs. Pearson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Water, please,&rdquo; she requested. But it failed
to revive the patient.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think she ought to go to the hospital, Mrs.
Pearson,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something terribly
wrong with her side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Pearson looked relieved: she had no desire
to nurse a sick old lady in her house, even
though she was her aunt. She told Corinne to
call for an ambulance.</p>
<p>It was not until two white-uniformed attendants
were actually putting her on the stretcher
that Miss Grant regained consciousness. Then
she opened her eyes and asked for Mary Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come with me, child!&rdquo; she begged. &ldquo;I want
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl nodded, and whispering a message
for her mother to Jane, she climbed into the ambulance
and rode to the hospital with the queer
old spinster.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">[126]</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="small">CHAPTER X</span>
<br /><i>Night at Dark Cedars</i></h2>
<p>Mary Louise sat in the waiting room of the Riverside
Hospital, idly looking at the magazines,
while the nurses took Miss Grant to her private
room. She couldn&rsquo;t help smiling a little as she
thought how vexed the old lady would be at the
bill she would get. Corinne Pearson had carelessly
told the hospital to have one of the best
rooms in readiness for the patient.</p>
<p>(&ldquo;But, if she had her own way, Miss Grant
would be in a ward,&rdquo; thought Mary Louise.)</p>
<p>However, it was too late now to dispute over
details. The head nurse came into the waiting
room and spoke to Mary Louise in a soft
voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Matilda Grant is your aunt, I suppose,
Miss&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gay,&rdquo; supplied Mary Louise. &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not
any relation. Just a friend&mdash;of her niece.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I see.... Yes, I know your father,
Miss Gay. He is a remarkable man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so too,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">[127]</div>
<p>&ldquo;As you no doubt expected,&rdquo; continued the
nurse, &ldquo;an operation is absolutely necessary. The
nurses are getting Miss Grant ready now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has she consented?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. She had to. It is certain death if the surgeon
doesn&rsquo;t operate immediately. But before she
goes under the anesthetic she wants to see you.
So please come with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A little surprised at the request, Mary Louise
followed the nurse through the hall of the spotless
hospital to the elevator and thence to Miss
Grant&rsquo;s room. The old lady was lying in a white
bed, attired in a plain, high-necked nightgown
which the hospital provided. Her face was
deathly pale, but her black eyes were as bright
as ever, and she smiled at Mary Louise as she
entered the room.</p>
<p>With her wrinkled hand she beckoned the girl
to a chair beside the bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a good girl, Mary Louise,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;and I trust you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise flushed a trifle at the praise; she
didn&rsquo;t know exactly what to say, so she kept quiet
and waited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you do something for me?&rdquo; asked the
old lady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course, Miss Grant,&rdquo; replied Mary
Louise. &ldquo;If I can.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">[128]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I want you to live at Dark Cedars while I&rsquo;m
here in the hospital. Take Jane with you, if you
want to, and your dog too&mdash;but plan to stay
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t be there every minute, Miss Grant.
Tomorrow I&rsquo;ve promised to go on a picnic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all right! I remember now, you
told me. Take Elsie with you. But go back to
Dark Cedars at night. <i>Sleep in my room.</i> And
shut the door!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise looked puzzled; she could not
see the reason for such a request.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there isn&rsquo;t anything valuable for anybody
to steal now, is there, Miss Grant?&rdquo; she inquired.
&ldquo;You put your money and your bonds in the
bank today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sick woman gasped for breath and for a
moment she could not speak. Finally she said,
&ldquo;You heard about last night from Hannah? And
saw the way things were upset?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. But if the burglars didn&rsquo;t take anything,
they won&rsquo;t be likely to return, will they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Grant closed her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t common burglars,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Mary Louise started. Did Miss Grant believe
in Hannah&rsquo;s theory about the ghosts?</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">[129]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I mean,&rdquo; answered the old
lady. &ldquo;Somebody&mdash;living or dead&mdash;is trying to
get hold of something very precious to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Miss Grant?&rdquo; demanded Mary
Louise eagerly. Oh, perhaps now she was getting
close to the real mystery at Dark Cedars! For
that petty theft by Corinne Pearson was only a
side issue, she felt sure.</p>
<p>The old lady shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell&mdash;even you, Mary Louise! Nobody!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then how can I help you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can watch Elsie and try to find out
where she hid my box of gold pieces. You can
keep your eye open for trouble at night&mdash;and let
me know if anything happens.... Will you
do it, Mary Louise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ask Mother&mdash;at least, if you&rsquo;ll let me tell
her all about what has happened. It won&rsquo;t get
around Riverside&mdash;Mother is used to keeping
secrets, you know, for my father is a detective.
And if she consents, I&rsquo;ll go and stay with Elsie
till you come home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tears of gratitude stood in the sick woman&rsquo;s
eyes; the promise evidently meant a great deal
to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, tell your mother,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And Jane&rsquo;s
mother. But nobody else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise stood up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">[130]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I must go now, Miss Grant. Your nurse has
been beckoning to me for the last two minutes.
You have to rest.... But I&rsquo;ll come in to see
you on Sunday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She walked out of the room, closing the door
softly behind her and thinking how sad it must
be to face an operation all alone, with no one&rsquo;s
loving kiss on your lips, no one&rsquo;s hopes and
prayers to sustain you. But, sorry as Mary Louise
was for Miss Grant, she could not show her any
affection. She couldn&rsquo;t forget or forgive her cruelty
to Elsie.</p>
<p>Her mother was waiting for her on the porch
when she arrived at her house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must be starved, Mary Louise!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
&ldquo;I have your lunch all ready for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks heaps, Mother&mdash;I am hungry. But
so much has happened. Did Jane tell you about
Miss Grant?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. But I can&rsquo;t see why <i>you</i> had to go to the
hospital with her when she has all those relatives
to look after her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise shrugged her shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t like her, Mother&mdash;and consequently
she doesn&rsquo;t trust them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you like her?&rdquo; inquired Mrs. Gay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t. But in a way I feel sorry for
her.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">[131]</div>
<p>Mary Louise followed her mother into the
dining room and for the next fifteen minutes
gave herself up to the enjoyment of the lovely
lunch of dainty sandwiches and refreshing iced
tea which her mother had so carefully prepared.
It was not until she had finished that she began
her story of the robbery at Dark Cedars and of
her own and Jane&rsquo;s part in the partial recovery
of the money. She made no mention, however, of
the bandit who had tried to hold them up, or of
the queer disturbances at night at Dark Cedars.
She concluded with the old lady&rsquo;s request that
they&mdash;Mary Louise and Jane&mdash;stay with Elsie
and watch her.</p>
<p>Mrs. Gay looked a little doubtful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, dear,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Something
might happen. Still, if Mrs. Patterson is willing
to let Jane go, I suppose I will say yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fifteen minutes later Mary Louise whistled
for her chum and put the proposition up to her.</p>
<p>Jane shivered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to stay in that spooky old
place!&rdquo; she protested. &ldquo;Not after what happened
there last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Who&rsquo;s afraid of the big, bad wolf?&rsquo;&rdquo; teased
Mary Louise. &ldquo;Jane, I thought you had more
sense!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">[132]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something uncanny about Dark
Cedars, Mary Lou, and you know it! Not just
that the house is old, and the boards creak, and
there aren&rsquo;t any electric lights. There&rsquo;s something
<i>evil</i> there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course there is. But that&rsquo;s the very reason
it thrills me. I don&rsquo;t agree with Miss Grant and
just want to go there because I believe Elsie is
guilty of stealing that gold and that maybe we
can find out where she has hidden it. Somebody
else took it, I&rsquo;m sure&mdash;and that somebody keeps
coming back to Dark Cedars to get <i>something</i>
else. Something valuable, &lsquo;precious to me,&rsquo; Miss
Grant called it. And we&rsquo;ve got to catch them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t tell your mother that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. I told her about only what has actually
been stolen so far. No need to alarm her. And
will you do the same with your mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane rose reluctantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose so. If you&rsquo;ve made up your mind to
go through with it, you&rsquo;ll do it. I know you well
enough for that. And I don&rsquo;t want you over there
at Dark Cedars alone&mdash;or only with Elsie. Even
Hannah and William are moving out, you remember....
Yes, I&rsquo;ll go. If Mother will let
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a peach, Jane!&rdquo; cried her chum joyfully.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">[133]</div>
<p>It was several hours, however, before the girls
actually started to Dark Cedars. Arrangements
for the picnic the following day had to be completed;
their suitcases had to be packed, and
their boy-friends called on the telephone. It was
after five o&rsquo;clock when they were finally ready.</p>
<p>From the porch of Mary Louise&rsquo;s house they
saw Max Miller drive up in his car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m taking you over,&rdquo; he announced, for
Mary Louise had told him that she and Jane
were visiting Elsie Grant for a few days.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nice, Max,&rdquo; replied Mary Louise.
&ldquo;We weren&rsquo;t so keen about carrying these suitcases
in all this heat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is terribly hot, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; remarked Mrs.
Gay. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid there will be a thunderstorm
before the day is over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane made a face. Dark Cedars was gloomy
enough without a storm to make it seem worse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, Silky!&rdquo; called Mary Louise.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re taking you this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say we are!&rdquo; exclaimed her chum emphatically.</p>
<p>Elsie Grant was delighted to see them. She
came running from behind the hedge attired in
her pink linen dress and her white shoes. Mary
Louise was thankful that Max did not see her in
the old purple calico. His sense of humor might
have got the better of him and brought forth a
wisecrack or two.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">[134]</div>
<p>As soon as they were out of the car she introduced
them to each other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t know we were coming for a visit,
did you, Elsie?&rdquo; she inquired. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll tell
you how it happened: Your aunt Mattie is in
the hospital for an operation, and she wanted
Jane and me to stay with you while she was
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl wrinkled her brows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t sound like Aunt Mattie,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;to be so thoughtful of me. She must have some
other motive besides pity for my loneliness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has!&rdquo; cried Jane. &ldquo;You can be sure&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise put her finger to her lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll tell you all about it later,&rdquo; she whispered
while Max was getting the suitcases from
the rumble seat. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite a story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Hannah still here?&rdquo; inquired Jane. &ldquo;Or do
we cook our own supper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, she&rsquo;s here,&rdquo; answered Elsie. &ldquo;She expects
to come every day to work in the house,
and William will take care of the garden and
the chickens and milk the cow just the same.
But they&rsquo;re going away every night after supper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Max, overhearing the last remark, looked disapproving.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">[135]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to tell me you three girls
will be here alone every night?&rdquo; he demanded.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re at least half a mile from the nearest
house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t worry, Max, we&rsquo;ll be all right,&rdquo;
returned Mary Louise lightly. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a family
of colored people who live in a shack down
in the valley behind the house. We can call on
them if it is necessary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speaking of them,&rdquo; remarked Elsie, &ldquo;reminds
me that William says half a dozen chickens
must have been stolen last night. At least,
they&rsquo;re missing, and of course he blames Abraham
Lincoln Jones. But I don&rsquo;t believe it. Mr.
Jones is a deacon in the Riverside Colored
Church, and his wife is the kindest woman. I
often stop in to see her, and she gives me gingerbread.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise and Jane exchanged significant
looks. Perhaps this colored family was the explanation
of the mysterious disturbances about
Dark Cedars.</p>
<p>Mary Louise suggested this to Elsie after Max
had driven away with a promise to call for the
girls at nine o&rsquo;clock the following morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; said Elsie. &ldquo;But of course
it&rsquo;s possible.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">[136]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s walk over to see this family after supper,&rdquo;
put in Jane. &ldquo;We might learn a lot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; agreed Elsie, &ldquo;if a storm doesn&rsquo;t
come up to stop us.... Now, come on upstairs
and unpack. What room are you going to sleep
in&mdash;Hannah&rsquo;s or Aunt Mattie&rsquo;s&mdash;or up in the
attic with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have to sleep in your aunt Mattie&rsquo;s bedroom,&rdquo;
replied Mary Louise. &ldquo;I promised we
would.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elsie looked disappointed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be so far away from me!&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you sleep on the second floor
too?&rdquo; inquired Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t any room that&rsquo;s furnished as a
bedroom, except Hannah&rsquo;s, and I think she still
has her things in that. Besides, Aunt Mattie
wouldn&rsquo;t like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, we&rsquo;ll leave our door open,&rdquo; promised
Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we can&rsquo;t do that either,&rdquo; asserted Mary
Louise. &ldquo;Miss Grant told me to close it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good gracious!&rdquo; exclaimed her chum. &ldquo;What
next?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Supper&rsquo;s ready!&rdquo; called Hannah from the
kitchen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">[137]</div>
<p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s next,&rdquo; laughed Mary Louise. &ldquo;Well,
we&rsquo;ll unpack after supper. I&rsquo;m not very hungry&mdash;I
had lunch so late&mdash;but I guess I can eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hannah came into the dining room and sat
down in a chair beside the window while the
girls ate their supper, so that she might hear the
news of her mistress. Mary Louise told everything&mdash;the
capture of the bills, the part Harry
Grant played in the affair, and Corinne Pearson&rsquo;s
guilt in the actual stealing. She went on to
describe Miss Grant&rsquo;s collapse and removal to
the Riverside Hospital, concluding with her request
that the two girls stay with Elsie while she
was away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So she still thinks I stole her gold pieces!&rdquo;
cried the orphan miserably.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid she does, Elsie,&rdquo; admitted Mary
Louise. &ldquo;But there&rsquo;s something else she&rsquo;s worrying
about. What could Miss Grant possibly own,
Hannah, that she&rsquo;s afraid of losing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know for sure,&rdquo; replied the servant.
&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll tell you what I think&mdash;if you won&rsquo;t
laugh at me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course we won&rsquo;t, Hannah,&rdquo; promised
Jane.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">[138]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there was something years ago that old
Mr. Grant got hold of&mdash;something valuable&mdash;that
I made out didn&rsquo;t belong to him. I don&rsquo;t
know what it was&mdash;never did know&mdash;but I&rsquo;d
hear Mrs. Grant&mdash;that was Miss Mattie&rsquo;s
mother, you understand&mdash;tryin&rsquo; to get him to
give it back. &lsquo;It can&rsquo;t do us no good,&rsquo; she&rsquo;d say&mdash;or
words like them. And he&rsquo;d always tell her
that he meant to keep it for a while; if they lost
everything else, this possession would keep &rsquo;em
out of the poorhouse for a spell. Mrs. Grant kept
askin&rsquo; him whereabouts it was hidden, and he
just laughed at her. I believe she died without
ever findin&rsquo; out....</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, whatever it was, Mr. Grant must have
give it to Miss Mattie when he died, and she
kept it hid somewheres in this house. No ordinary
place, or I&rsquo;d have found it in house-cleanin&rsquo;.
You can&rsquo;t houseclean for forty years, twicet
a year, without knowin&rsquo; &rsquo;bout everything in a
house.... But I never seen nuthin&rsquo; valuable
outside that safe of her&rsquo;n.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So what I think is,&rdquo; continued Hannah, keeping
her eyes fixed on Mary Louise, &ldquo;that Mrs.
Grant can&rsquo;t rest in her grave till that thing is
give back to whoever it belongs to. I believe her
spirit visits this house at night, lookin&rsquo; for it, and
turnin&rsquo; things upside down to find it. That&rsquo;s why
nuthin&rsquo; ain&rsquo;t never stolen. So anybody that lives
here ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; have no peace at nights till she
finds it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">[139]</div>
<p>Hannah stopped talking, and, as Jane had
promised, nobody laughed. As a matter of fact,
nobody felt like laughing. The woman&rsquo;s belief
in her explanation was too sincere to be derided.
The girls sat perfectly still, forgetting even to
eat, thinking solemnly of what she had told
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to find out what the thing is,&rdquo; announced
Mary Louise finally, &ldquo;if we expect to
make any headway. I wish I could go see Miss
Mattie at the hospital tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Jane firmly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
going to that picnic. We can ask the gypsies
when we have our fortunes told.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gypsies!&rdquo; exclaimed Hannah scornfully.
&ldquo;Gypsies ain&rsquo;t no good! They used to camp
around here till they drove Miss Mattie wild
and she got the police after &rsquo;em. Don&rsquo;t have
nuthin&rsquo; to do with gypsies!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re just going to have our fortunes told,&rdquo;
explained Jane. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t expect to invite them
to our houses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; was the servant&rsquo;s warning as
she left the room.</p>
<p>When the girls had finished their supper they
went upstairs to Miss Grant&rsquo;s bedroom and unpacked
their suitcases. But they were too tired
to walk down the hill to call upon Abraham Lincoln
Jones. If he wanted to steal chickens tonight,
he was welcome to, as far as they were
concerned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">[140]</div>
<p>Hannah and William left about eight o&rsquo;clock,
locking the kitchen door behind them, and the
girls stayed out on the front porch until ten, talking
and singing to Jane&rsquo;s ukulele. The threatening
storm had not arrived when they finally went
to bed.</p>
<p>It was so still, so hot outdoors that not even a
branch moved in the darkness. The very silence
was oppressive; Jane was sure that she wouldn&rsquo;t
be able to go to sleep when she got into Miss
Mattie&rsquo;s wooden bed with its ugly carving on
the headboard. But, in spite of the heat, both
girls dropped off in less than five minutes.</p>
<p>They were awakened sometime after two by
a loud clap of thunder. Branches of the trees
close to the house were lashing against the windows,
and the rain was pouring in. Mary Louise
jumped up to shut the window. As she crawled
back into bed she heard footsteps in the hall.
Light footsteps, scarcely perceptible above the
rain. But someone&mdash;something&mdash;was stealthily
approaching their door!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">[141]</div>
<p>Her instinct was to reach for the electric-light
button when she remembered that Miss Grant
used only oil lamps. Trembling, she groped in
the darkness for her flashlight, on the chair beside
her. But before she found it the handle rattled
on the door, and it opened&mdash;slowly and
quietly.</p>
<p>There, dimly perceptible in the blackness of
the hall, stood a figure&mdash;all in white!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">[142]</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="small">CHAPTER XI</span>
<br /><i>The Picnic</i></h2>
<p>The figure in white remained motionless in
the doorway of Miss Grant&rsquo;s room. Mary Louise
continued to sit rigid in the bed, while Jane,
who was still lying down, clutched her chum&rsquo;s
arm with a grip that actually hurt.</p>
<p>For a full minute there was no sound in the
room. Then a flash of lightning revealed the
cause of the girls&rsquo; terror.</p>
<p>Mary Louise burst out laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elsie!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;You certainly had us
scared!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane sat up angrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the idea, sneaking in like a ghost?&rdquo;
she demanded.</p>
<p>The orphan started to sob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was afraid of waking you,&rdquo; she explained.
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to frighten you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s all right now,&rdquo; said Mary Louise
soothingly. &ldquo;Ordinarily we shouldn&rsquo;t have been
scared. But in this house, where everybody talks
about seeing ghosts all the time, it&rsquo;s natural for
us to be keyed up.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">[143]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why that woman doesn&rsquo;t put in electricity,&rdquo;
muttered Jane, &ldquo;is more than I can see. It&rsquo;s positively
barbarous!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come over and sit here on the bed, Elsie,
and tell us why you came downstairs,&rdquo; invited
Mary Louise. &ldquo;Are you afraid of the storm?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, a little bit. But I thought I heard something
down in the yard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old Mrs. Grant&rsquo;s ghost?&rdquo; inquired Jane
lightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it was Abraham Lincoln Jones, returning
for more chickens,&rdquo; surmised Mary
Louise. &ldquo;But no, it couldn&rsquo;t be, or Silky would
be barking&mdash;he could hear that from the cellar&mdash;so
it must be just the wind, Elsie. It does make
an uncanny sound through all those trees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I stay here till the storm is over?&rdquo; asked
the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If it had not been so hot, Mary Louise would
have told Elsie to sleep with them. But three in
a bed, and a rather uncomfortable bed at that,
was too close quarters on a night like this.</p>
<p>The storm lasted for perhaps an hour, while
the girls sat chatting together. As the thundering
subsided, Jane began to yawn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose I go up to the attic and sleep with
Elsie?&rdquo; she said to Mary Louise, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;re not
afraid to stay in this room by yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">[144]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I&rsquo;m not!&rdquo; replied her chum. &ldquo;I
think that&rsquo;s a fine idea, and your being there will
prevent Elsie from being nervous and hearing
things. Does it suit you, Elsie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes! Oh, I&rsquo;d love it! If you&rsquo;re sure you don&rsquo;t
mind, Mary Louise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t expect to mind anything in about five
minutes,&rdquo; yawned Mary Louise. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m dead for
sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was correct in her surmise: she knew nothing
at all until the bright sunshine was pouring
into her room and Jane wakened her by throwing
a pillow at her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wake up, lazybones!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you
realize that today is the picnic?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise threw the pillow back at her
chum and jumped out of bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a glorious day!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;And
so much cooler.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elsie, attired in her new pink linen dress,
dashed into the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, this is something like!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I
haven&rsquo;t heard any gayety like this for three
years!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mary Louise is always &lsquo;Gay,&rsquo;&rdquo; remarked
Jane demurely. &ldquo;In fact, she&rsquo;ll be &lsquo;Gay&rsquo; till she
gets married.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">[145]</div>
<p>Her chum hurled the other pillow from Miss
Grant&rsquo;s bed just as Hannah poked her nose into
the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you girls throw them pillows around!&rdquo;
she commanded. &ldquo;Miss Mattie is that careful
about her bed&mdash;she even makes it herself. And at
house-cleanin&rsquo; time I ain&rsquo;t allowed to touch it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a wonder she let you sleep on it, Mary
Louise,&rdquo; observed Elsie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Made</i> me sleep on it, you mean.&rdquo; Then, of
Hannah, she inquired, &ldquo;How soon do we have
breakfast?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right away, soon as you&rsquo;re dressed. Then you
girls can help pack up some doughnuts and rolls
I made for your picnic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re an angel, Hannah!&rdquo; exclaimed Mary
Louise. To the girls she said, &ldquo;Scram, if you
want me downstairs in two minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Soon after breakfast the cars arrived. There
were three of them&mdash;the two sports roadsters belonging
to Max Miller and Norman Wilder,
and a sedan driven by one of the girls of their
crowd, a small, red-haired girl named Hope
Dorsey, who looked like Janet Gaynor.</p>
<p>Max had brought an extra boy for Elsie, a
junior at high school, by the name of Kenneth
Dormer, and Mary Louise introduced him, putting
him with Elsie in Max&rsquo;s rumble seat. She
herself got into the front.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">[146]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Got your swimming suit, Mary Lou?&rdquo; asked
Max, as he started his car with its usual sudden
leap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;As a matter of fact,
I brought two of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t noticed you were getting that fat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just about enough out of you! I don&rsquo;t
admire the Mae West figure, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why two suits?&rdquo; inquired the young
man. &ldquo;Change of costume?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One for Elsie and one for me,&rdquo; explained
Mary Louise. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe Elsie can swim,
but she&rsquo;ll soon learn. Will you teach her, Max?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll get a chance to, from the
way I saw Ken making eyes at her. He&rsquo;ll probably
have a monopoly on the teaching.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise smiled: this was just the way she
wanted things to be.</p>
<p>The picnic grounds near Cooper&rsquo;s woods were
only a couple of miles from Riverside. A wide
stream which flowed through the woods had
been dammed up for swimming, and here the
boys and men of Riverside had built two rough
shacks for dressing houses. The cars were no
sooner unloaded than the boys and girls dashed
for their respective bath houses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Last one in the pool is a monkey!&rdquo; called
Max, as he locked his car.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">[147]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;ll be the monkey,&rdquo; remarked Elsie.
&ldquo;Because I have a suit I&rsquo;m not familiar with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll help you,&rdquo; offered Mary Louise.</p>
<p>They were dressed in no time at all; as usual
the girls were ahead of the boys. They were all
in the water by the time the boys came out of
their shack.</p>
<p>The pool was empty except for a few children,
so the young people from Riverside had a
chance to play water games and to dive to their
hearts&rsquo; content. Everybody except Elsie Grant
knew how to swim, and Mary Louise and several
of the others were capable of executing
some remarkable stunt diving.</p>
<p>Before noontime arrived Elsie found herself
venturing into the deeper parts of the pool, and,
with Kenneth or Mary Louise beside her, she
actually swam several yards. All the while she
was laughing and shouting as she had not done
since her parents&rsquo; death; the cloud of suspicion
that had been hanging over her head for the past
few days was forgotten. She was a normal, happy
girl again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">[148]</div>
<p>The lunch that followed provided even more
fun and hilarity than the swim. It seemed as if
their mothers had supplied everything in the
world to eat. Cakes and pies and sandwiches;
hot dogs and steaks to be cooked over the fire
which the boys built; ice cream in dry ice, and
refreshing drinks of fruit juices, iced tea, and
soda water. Keen as their appetites were from
the morning&rsquo;s swim, the young people could not
begin to eat everything they had brought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have enough left for supper,&rdquo; said
Mary Louise, leaning back against a tree trunk
with a sigh of content.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the ants don&rsquo;t eat it up,&rdquo; returned Jane.
&ldquo;We better cover things up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do it right away,&rdquo; announced Hope
Dorsey. &ldquo;Come on, boys! you burn rubbish, and
we girls will pack food.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t move,&rdquo; protested Max. &ldquo;The ants are
welcome to their share as far as I&rsquo;m concerned.
I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll ever eat again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hate <i>aunts</i>,&rdquo; said Elsie, with a sly look at
Mary Louise and Jane. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want them to
get a thing, so I&rsquo;ll help put the food away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Max and a couple of the other lazier boys
were pulled to their feet by Kenneth and Norman,
and the picnic spot was soon as clean as
when the party had arrived. Hope Dorsey suggested
that they drive back to her home later in
the afternoon and have supper on the lawn.
Then they could turn on the radio and dance on
her big screened porch.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">[149]</div>
<p>&ldquo;When do we visit these gypsies you were
talking about, Max?&rdquo; demanded Jane. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
keen to hear my fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re back towards Riverside,&rdquo; replied
the youth. &ldquo;About half a mile from Dark
Cedars,&rdquo; he added, to Mary Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They used to camp at Dark Cedars&mdash;at least,
some gypsies did,&rdquo; Elsie informed the party. &ldquo;If
they&rsquo;re the same ones, you&rsquo;d think they wouldn&rsquo;t
come back, after they were driven away by the
police.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that what your aunt did?&rdquo; inquired Kenneth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, so Hannah says&mdash;Hannah is the maid,
you know. She says Aunt Mattie hates them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young people piled into the cars again,
and Max led the way, off the main highway to a
dirt road extending behind Dark Cedars.
Through the trees they could catch a glimpse of
the gypsy encampment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has everybody some money&mdash;in silver?&rdquo; inquired
Max, after the cars were parked beside
the road. &ldquo;The gypsies insist on gold and silver.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise nodded; she was prepared for
herself as well as for Elsie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do we all go in in a bunch?&rdquo; asked Hope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not!&rdquo; replied Max. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t
think we could tell our secrets in front of the
whole bunch, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">[150]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Must be pretty bad,&rdquo; observed Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, then, if that&rsquo;s the way you feel
about it, I&rsquo;ll go in with you!&rdquo; challenged Norman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suits me,&rdquo; returned the girl, with a wink at
Mary Louise.</p>
<p>As the crowd came closer to the gypsy encampment,
they saw the usual tents, the caravan,
which was a motor truck, and a fire, over which
a kettle was smoldering. Half a dozen children,
dressed in ordinary clothing but without shoes
and stockings, were playing under a tree, and
there were several women about. But there did
not appear to be any men at the camp at the
time.</p>
<p>One of the women, who had been standing
over the fire, came forward to meet the young
people. She was past middle age, Mary Louise
judged, from her dark, wrinkled skin, but her
hair was jet black, and her movements were as
agile and as graceful as a girl&rsquo;s. She wore a long
dress of a deep blue color, without any touch of
the reds and yellows one usually associates with
gypsies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fortunes?&rdquo; she asked, smiling, and revealing
an ugly gap in her front teeth, which made her
look almost like a story-book witch.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">[151]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How much?&rdquo; asked Max, holding up a
quarter in his hand.</p>
<p>The gypsy shook her head. &ldquo;One dollar,&rdquo; she
announced.</p>
<p>Max pulled down the corners of his mouth
and looked doubtfully at his friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are fourteen of us,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Fourteen
at fifty cents each is seven dollars. All in
silver.... Take it or leave it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman regarded him shrewdly; she saw
that he meant what he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; she agreed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go into my tent
and get ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young people turned to Max with whispered
congratulations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She certainly speaks perfect English,&rdquo; remarked
Mary Louise.</p>
<p>They sat down on the grass while they waited
for the gypsy woman to summon them, and when
the tent flap finally opened, Jane Patterson and
Norman Wilder jumped to their feet and
walked over to the fortune teller first.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll think you two are engaged, Jane,&rdquo;
teased Hope, &ldquo;if you go in together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then she&rsquo;ll get fooled,&rdquo; returned the other
girl laughingly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">[152]</div>
<p>The couple were absent for perhaps five minutes.
When they came out of the tent Jane
dashed down the hill to the road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The gypsy told her that her class ring is in
my car,&rdquo; explained Norman to the others. &ldquo;The
one she lost, you remember? She said it&rsquo;s under
the seat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could have suggested that she look there
myself,&rdquo; remarked Max. &ldquo;Only I thought, of
course, that she already had.... Shall I try
my luck next, or will one of you girls go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d love to go,&rdquo; offered Hope Dorsey. &ldquo;I
simply can&rsquo;t wait. By the way, did she think
you two were engaged?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, she didn&rsquo;t. She&rsquo;s pretty wise, after all.
She told me some astounding things. One was
that a relation had just died&mdash;my uncle did, you
know&mdash;and that we&rsquo;re going to get some money....
I hope that part&rsquo;s true.... You have to
hand it to her. I don&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s all just the
bunk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hope ran into the tent, and while she was
gone Jane returned triumphantly from the car
with her lost ring. Mary Louise&rsquo;s eyes flashed
with excitement: perhaps the gypsy was really
possessed of second sight. Oh, if she could only
solve that mystery at Dark Cedars!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">[153]</div>
<p>Mary Louise was last of all the group to enter
the fortune teller&rsquo;s tent. The woman was seated
on the ground with a dirty pack of cards in her
hands. She indicated that the girl should sit
down beside her and gave her the cards to
shuffle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m really not interested in my fortune half
so much as I am in a mystery I&rsquo;m involved in,&rdquo;
explained Mary Louise. She paused, wondering
whether the gypsy would understand what she
was talking about. Perhaps she ought to use simpler
language.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean you want to ask me questions?&rdquo;
inquired the woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; replied Mary Louise. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
staying at Dark Cedars now, and there are
strange things going on there. Maybe you can
explain them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dark Cedars!&rdquo; repeated the gypsy. &ldquo;I know
the place.... You don&rsquo;t live there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t live there. I&rsquo;m just staying there
while Miss Grant is in the hospital.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The black eyes gleamed, and the woman held
two thin, dirty hands in front of her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mattie Grant is <i>evil</i>,&rdquo; she announced. &ldquo;Keep
away from her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise wrinkled her brows. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not
with her,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m only staying at Dark
Cedars while Miss Grant is away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why is that?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">[154]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what I want to ask you! Miss
Grant&rsquo;s money has already been stolen, and I
thought maybe you could tell me what I&rsquo;m supposed
to be protecting&mdash;by sleeping in her bed
every night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the old witch&rsquo;s bed? Oh-ho!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; It struck Mary Louise funny that this
gypsy woman should call Miss Grant a witch
when she herself looked much more like one.</p>
<p>The gypsy, however, was giving her attention
to the cards, shuffling them, and finally drawing
one of them out of the deck. She laid it face
up in Mary Louise&rsquo;s lap and nodded significantly.
It was the eight of hearts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mattie Grant&rsquo;s treasure&mdash;is&mdash;a ruby necklace,&rdquo;
she announced slowly, staring hard at the
card. &ldquo;With eight precious rubies!&rdquo; She handed
the card to Mary Louise. &ldquo;Count them for yourself!&rdquo;
she said.</p>
<p>Mary Louise gazed at the woman in amazement,
not knowing whether to believe her or
not. The explanation was plausible, but it
seemed rather foolish to her&mdash;that the eight of
hearts should mean eight rubies.... Would
the ace of diamonds have indicated a diamond
ring?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">[155]</div>
<p>But there was no use in questioning the
gypsy&rsquo;s power, no point in antagonizing her. So,
instead, she changed the subject by telling her
that a box of gold pieces had been stolen from
the safe in Miss Grant&rsquo;s bedroom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you can tell me who took them?&rdquo;
she suggested.</p>
<p>The woman picked up the cards and shuffled
them again, muttering something unintelligible
to herself as she did it. Once more she drew out
a card, seemingly at random. This time it was
the queen of diamonds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A light-haired girl&mdash;or woman,&rdquo; she announced.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all I can say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise gasped. Elsie Grant had light
hair&mdash;but, then, so did Corinne Pearson....
And Mrs. Grace Grant&rsquo;s hair was gray.</p>
<p>The gypsy rose from the ground as lightly and
as easily as a girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;ve had more than your time,
miss,&rdquo; she concluded. &ldquo;Now, please to go!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">[156]</div>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="small">CHAPTER XII</span>
<br /><i>Bound and Gagged</i></h2>
<p>&ldquo;How was your fortune, Mary Louise?&rdquo; inquired
Max, as the former emerged from the
gypsy&rsquo;s tent and joined the merry group in the
field. &ldquo;Did she say you&rsquo;d marry a tall, good-looking
fellow, with lots of personality?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, she didn&rsquo;t. I guess I&rsquo;m going to be an
old maid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;re the only one,&rdquo; remarked Hope.
&ldquo;All the rest of us get rich husbands and trips
around the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elsie came up close to Mary Louise and whispered
in her ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She told me to leave Dark Cedars,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;How do you suppose she knew that I lived
there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must have seen you around, I suppose,&rdquo; replied
Mary Louise. &ldquo;She warned me to get out
too, but then I told her I was staying there....
But don&rsquo;t tell Jane, Elsie. She&rsquo;d go in a minute
if she heard that.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">[157]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t we better all go&mdash;till Aunt Mattie
gets back from the hospital? Wouldn&rsquo;t your
mother let me stay at your house if I worked for
my board?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course she would. You wouldn&rsquo;t have to
work any more than I do&mdash;just help Mother a
little. But I promised your aunt I&rsquo;d live at her
place and sleep in her bed, and I&rsquo;m going to stay.
There&rsquo;s some explanation for all this superstition
about Dark Cedars, and I mean to find it out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop whispering secrets!&rdquo; commanded Max
Miller, separating the two girls forcibly. &ldquo;Of
course, Ken and I know you&rsquo;re talking about us,
and what you&rsquo;re saying is probably complimentary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elsie laughed and followed Mary Louise into
the car. The group drove to Hope Dorsey&rsquo;s, as
she had suggested, and ate the rest of the picnic
food for their supper. Another round of fun followed,
and it was after ten when the party finally
broke up.</p>
<p>Dropping Kenneth Dormer at his own home,
Max ran the three girls back to Dark Cedars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think I better go into the house
and light the lamps for you?&rdquo; he inquired. &ldquo;It
looks so spooky in there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we have Silky for protection,&rdquo; returned
Mary Louise lightly. &ldquo;Thank you just the same,
Max.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">[158]</div>
<p>The young man waited, however, until he saw
the girls unlock the front door and light the
lamp in the hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything&rsquo;s O.K.!&rdquo; shouted Mary Louise.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be asleep inside of ten minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Max waved back again and started his engine.
Elsie lighted two more lamps which Hannah
had left in readiness for the girls, and all together,
with Silky at their heels, they mounted
the creaking staircase.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t sleep upstairs, Silky!&rdquo; said Mary
Louise to her dog. &ldquo;Miss Grant would never allow
that. Go down to your box in the cellar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The spaniel seemed to understand, for he stood
still, wagging his tail and looking pleadingly at
his mistress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s a shame to send him off by himself,&rdquo;
remarked Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; agreed Mary Louise. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s got
to be done. He&rsquo;d get up on the bed, as likely as
not&mdash;the way he does at home. And just imagine
what Miss Grant would think of that! Her
precious bed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Turning about, she led the little dog to the
cellar, and there, in a box next to the kitten&rsquo;s,
he settled down to sleep. When she returned the
girls were waiting for her in Miss Grant&rsquo;s bedroom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do we sleep tonight?&rdquo; inquired Elsie.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">[159]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you can have Jane again if you want
her,&rdquo; agreed Mary Louise. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t make any
difference to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The younger girl was delighted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only,&rdquo; added Mary Louise, &ldquo;if you expect
to do any prowling around tonight, please shout
your presence in the room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I expect to go right to sleep,&rdquo; replied Elsie.
&ldquo;With Jane beside me, I&rsquo;ll feel safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise smiled and kissed her goodnight.
In many ways Elsie Grant seemed like a
child to her, in spite of her fifteen years.</p>
<p>Alone in the room, she undressed quickly,
hanging her clothing on a chair, for she could
not bring herself to use that big, old closet, filled
with Miss Grant&rsquo;s things. She was very tired,
and, thankful that the night was so much cooler
than the preceding one, she blew out the lamp
and crawled into bed.</p>
<p>The utter blackness of the room was rather
appalling, even to a courageous girl like Mary
Louise. Accustomed as she was to the street lights
of Riverside, the darkness was thick and strange,
for the denseness of the trees about Dark Cedars
shut out even the sky, with its stars, from the
windows. But Mary Louise closed her eyes immediately,
resolved not to let anything so trivial
bother her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">[160]</div>
<p>The girls in the attic had quieted down; the
house was in absolute silence. Mary Louise, too,
lay very still. Listening.... She almost believed
that she heard somebody breathing!</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s absurd!&rdquo; she reprimanded herself
sharply. &ldquo;It couldn&rsquo;t be a ghost, as Hannah insists,
for ghosts don&rsquo;t breathe. And it couldn&rsquo;t
be a robber trying to get into the house, or
Silky would be barking. That dog has keen
ears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned over and put the thought out of
her mind by recalling the high lights of the picnic,
and soon dozed off. But she knew that she
had not been asleep long when she was suddenly
awakened by the low, squeaking creak of a
door.</p>
<p>Thinking it was probably Elsie, restless after
too much picnic food, Mary Louise opened her
eyes and peered about in the darkness. Now she
heard that breathing distinctly&mdash;and something
big and dark seemed to be moving towards her,
something blacker than the darkness of the
room. No face was visible to her until the figure
bent over close to her in the bed. Then she beheld
two gleaming eyes!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">[161]</div>
<p>She opened her lips to scream, but at the same
instant a thin hand was clapped over her mouth,
making utterance impossible. Both her hands
were caught and held in an iron grip, and a bag
was pulled over her head and tied so tightly
under her chin that she believed she would
choke.</p>
<p>Mary Louise could see nothing now, but she
felt a rope being twisted around her body, tying
her arms to her sides. In another second she was
lifted bodily and tossed roughly into Miss
Grant&rsquo;s closet.... The key was turned in the
lock.</p>
<p>In wild desperation Mary Louise tried to
shout, but the thickness and tightness of the bag
over her head muffled the sound, and the closet
walls closed it in. The girls in the attic would
never hear her, for they were at the back of the
house, and probably sleeping soundly. So she
abandoned the effort, and became quiet, twisting
her hands about under the rope, and listening to
the sounds from the room.</p>
<p>Whoever, whatever it was that had attacked
her was moving about stealthily, making a queer
noise that sounded like the tearing of a garment.
For a brief moment the thought of Corinne
Pearson jumped into her mind. Had the girl
come here to get revenge on Mary Louise for
disclosing her guilt, and was she tearing her
clothes to pieces?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">[162]</div>
<p>But such an explanation was too absurd to be
possible. It couldn&rsquo;t be Corinne&mdash;she was at that
dance with Ned Mason. But it might be Harry
Grant, searching for that precious possession of
his aunt Mattie&rsquo;s&mdash;that ruby necklace, if the
gypsy was correct.... But, no, Mary Louise
did not believe it was Harry&mdash;or any man.
Something about the motion of the figure, the
touch of its hands, proclaimed it to be feminine....
She thought of that ghost Hannah had described,
the spirit of dead Mrs. Grant, looking
for the hidden treasure, and she shuddered.</p>
<p>The tearing and ripping was becoming more
pronounced. Mary Louise listened more intently,
still twisting her hands about in an effort
to free them.</p>
<p>She heard a chair being moved away from
the window, and the screen being taken away....
She twisted her hands again.... Her
right hand&mdash;was free!</p>
<p>In spite of her terror, Mary Louise almost
sang out with joy.</p>
<p>The next sound she heard was a dear, familiar
noise, a sound that sent a thrill through
her whole body. It was the infuriated bark of
her little dog Silky from the cellar.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">[163]</div>
<p>Mary Louise lost no time in freeing her other
hand and in untying the knot about her chin
which fastened the bag over her head. She was
free at last&mdash;as far as her limbs were concerned.
But she was still locked securely in Miss Grant&rsquo;s
closet.</p>
<p>Through the crack of the door she perceived a
streak of light; the intruder had not worked in
darkness. But in a second it was extinguished,
and she heard a noise at the window.</p>
<p>Then&mdash;utter blackness and silence again!</p>
<p>Mary Louise raised her voice now and
screamed at the top of her lungs. She was rewarded
by the sound of hurrying footsteps and
the incessant bark of her dog, coming nearer and
nearer. In another moment she heard the girls
in the room and saw the gleam of a flashlight
through the crack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m locked in the closet!&rdquo; she shouted. &ldquo;Let
me out, Jane!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her chum turned the key in the door. Thank
heaven, it was still there! Blinded by the light
from the flash, Mary Louise staggered out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; demanded Jane, her face
deathly pale with terror.</p>
<p>Mary Louise stumbled towards the bed. &ldquo;No
bones broken, thank goodness!&rdquo; she exclaimed,
sitting down carefully upon the bed. But she
jumped up immediately.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">[164]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happened to this bed?&rdquo; she demanded.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s full of pins and needles!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her chum turned the flashlight upon the ugly
piece of furniture, and Mary Louise perceived
at once the explanation of the ripping sound she
had heard. The bed clothing was literally torn
to pieces; the mattress was cut in a dozen places,
and straw strewn all over the floor. No wonder
it felt sharp to sit down on!</p>
<p>&ldquo;So the ruby necklace was hidden in the bed!&rdquo;
she muttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What ruby necklace?&rdquo; demanded Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what the gypsy said Miss Grant was
treasuring so carefully. She probably just made
a guess at it&mdash;to seem wise. It may be a diamond
ring, for all I know.... Anyhow, somebody
stole it. Who could it have been?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell us exactly what happened,&rdquo; begged
Jane.</p>
<p>Briefly Mary Louise told the grim story.
Elsie had lighted the lamp, and the girls sat
about on chairs, listening intently. Silky, who
had stopped barking now, climbed into his mistress&rsquo;s
lap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Funny Elsie didn&rsquo;t hear you try to scream
the first time,&rdquo; remarked Jane. &ldquo;She was awake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were?&rdquo; asked Mary Louise. &ldquo;What time
is it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">[165]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only quarter-past eleven,&rdquo; answered
Elsie. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t go to sleep&mdash;too much chocolate
cake and apple pie, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was Silky who waked me up,&rdquo; said Jane.
&ldquo;I heard him barking. And I looked for Elsie
and saw she wasn&rsquo;t in bed. So I thought he was
just barking at her, prowling around the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise opened her eyes wide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where were you, Elsie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;was down in the kitchen, getting some
baking soda.&rdquo; She burst into tears. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t
think I did that fiendish thing, do you, Mary
Louise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, of course not.&rdquo; But Mary Louise knew
that Miss Grant would not be so ready to accept
her niece&rsquo;s innocence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We better make a tour of the house,&rdquo; she
suggested, standing up and going over to the
window, where she noticed that the screen was
out, lying on the floor. &ldquo;I think the intruder must
have gotten out this way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s not the window with the porch
underneath,&rdquo; objected Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but he could have used a ladder,&rdquo; returned
Mary Louise.</p>
<p>The girls slipped coats over their pajamas and
put on their shoes. With Silky close at their
heels, they went downstairs and out the front
door, around to the side of the house.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">[166]</div>
<p>The first thing that they spied was a ladder,
lying on the ground perpendicular to the wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s William&rsquo;s ladder,&rdquo; announced Elsie.
&ldquo;He often leaves it around. It seems to me he
had it out yesterday, nailing up a board on the
porch roof.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only we could find some footprints,&rdquo; said
Mary Louise, flashing her light on the ground.</p>
<p>But she could see no marks. If the intruder
had made off that way, he had been wise enough
to walk over the rounds of the ladder. And
everywhere cedar needles covered the ground,
making footprints almost impossible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait till Aunt Mattie hears about this!&rdquo;
sobbed Elsie. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be the end of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t tell her till she gets better,&rdquo; decided
Mary Louise. &ldquo;Maybe by that time we&rsquo;ll
discover a clue that will help us solve the mystery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I hope so!&rdquo; breathed the young girl
fervently.</p>
<p>All this time, however, Jane said nothing. But
she was watching Elsie closely, as if she was
beginning to believe that she might be guilty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go to bed,&rdquo; concluded Mary Louise
when the tour of inspection was finished. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
going to sleep in Hannah&rsquo;s room&mdash;and I&rsquo;m going
to keep Silky with me this time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">[167]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you had taken that precaution before,&rdquo;
sighed Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I. But it&rsquo;s too late now. Let&rsquo;s get some
sleep, for tomorrow we have to get to work&mdash;and
work fast!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">[168]</div>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="small">CHAPTER XIII</span>
<br /><i>Detective Work</i></h2>
<p>Sunday morning dawned clear and peaceful.
As Mary Louise wakened to hear the birds singing
in the trees outside the window of Hannah&rsquo;s
old room at Dark Cedars, she could hardly believe
in the terrifying experience of the previous
night. It was just like a horrible dream, incredible
in the morning sunshine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe I&rsquo;d like to go to Sunday school,&rdquo;
she said to Jane at the breakfast table. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a
lovely day, and we&rsquo;d see all our friends. Don&rsquo;t
you want to come along too, Elsie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young girl, still pale and nervous from
the night before, shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, thank you, Mary Louise,&rdquo; she replied.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stay home and help Hannah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise glanced up apprehensively. As
yet the servant had not been informed of the
mysterious intruder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you tell her what happened last night?&rdquo;
she asked, in a low tone. &ldquo;Or shall we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I will,&rdquo; agreed Elsie. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be sure it
was Mrs. Grant&rsquo;s ghost again.... And I&rsquo;ll
help her fix up the bedroom.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">[169]</div>
<p>Mary Louise nodded. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll come, Jane?&rdquo;
she inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m leaving&mdash;for good!&rdquo; announced her
chum. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t spend another night at Dark
Cedars for all the necklaces in the world!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise said nothing: there was no use
arguing with Jane. As she went out of the door
with Silky at her heels she called to Hannah that
she alone would be back to dinner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About two o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; returned the woman.
&ldquo;And ain&rsquo;t Miss Jane comin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Hannah,&rdquo; answered the girl for herself.
&ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t see you again. Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls were some distance beyond the
hedge of Dark Cedars when Mary Louise asked
her companion her reason for leaving. &ldquo;Because,&rdquo;
she added, &ldquo;now that everything valuable
has been stolen, I don&rsquo;t see what you have to
fear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane hesitated a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hate to say it, Mary Lou, but I feel I must
tell you&mdash;for your own protection. It&rsquo;s <i>Elsie</i> I&rsquo;m
afraid of. I really believe she is guilty. I think
she has those gold pieces hidden somewhere at
Dark Cedars&mdash;and now the necklace. I think
she&rsquo;s a sneak, and I believe she&rsquo;s planning a getaway.
But if one of us should discover her theft,
I&rsquo;m afraid she&rsquo;d do something desperate to us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">[170]</div>
<p>An expression of pain passed over Mary
Louise&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;Go on, and tell me why you suspect
her,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On account of last night. Figure it out for
yourself. If that had been a burglar, why
wouldn&rsquo;t Silky have barked when he was getting
into the house? Why wouldn&rsquo;t Elsie have heard
him, if she was down in the kitchen, as she said?
And how could he have gotten away so quickly?
You think maybe he went out that window at
the side of the house, but that&rsquo;s only a guess.
Elsie could have <i>pretended</i> to make an escape
from the window while you were locked in the
closet and then have slipped out the door and
down to the kitchen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise gasped in horror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t sound possible,&rdquo; she admitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the way she protested her innocence immediately,&rdquo;
added Jane. &ldquo;Remember that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I do. But there is a possible explanation,
Jane. The burglar might have broken into the
house while we were away and been hiding in
the closet while I got ready for bed. I didn&rsquo;t
open the door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why would he do that? Why wouldn&rsquo;t
he finish the job and leave before we came
back?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">[171]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He might have just gotten in about the time
we arrived at Dark Cedars.&rdquo; She paused, thinking
of Corinne Pearson. &ldquo;Suppose it was
Corinne&mdash;on her way to that dance&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane shook her head. &ldquo;Possible, but not probable,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;No, I believe it was Elsie. Do
you remember how pleased she was that I wasn&rsquo;t
going to sleep with you in Miss Mattie&rsquo;s room?
And how she sneaked in there night before last,
scaring us so? Oh, Mary Lou, I think all the
evidence points that way. And she&rsquo;s beginning
to notice our suspicion. That&rsquo;s why she was so
quiet at breakfast&mdash;and so glad to get rid of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise was silent; she did not tell Jane
that she felt convinced that the burglar was of
the feminine gender.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t say anything about our experience
to anybody,&rdquo; cautioned Mary Louise as
the girls entered the Sunday school building. &ldquo;I
may talk it over with Daddy, if he&rsquo;s home. But
nobody else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane promised, and they both dismissed their
troubles for the time being in the presence of
their friends.</p>
<p>It was eleven o&rsquo;clock when the two girls came
out of the building, to find Silky patiently waiting
for them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">[172]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You take him home, Jane,&rdquo; said Mary
Louise, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll stop at the hospital. If I can
do so tactfully, I want to find out whether it
really was a ruby necklace that was hidden in
the bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Mary Louise&rsquo;s visit proved a disappointment;
she was told at the desk that it would be
impossible for her or anyone else to see Miss
Mattie Grant at the present time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The operation was successful,&rdquo; the attendant
stated, in that matter-of-fact tone officials so
often assume, &ldquo;but Miss Grant is under the influence
of a narcotic. She wouldn&rsquo;t know anybody....
Come back tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise nodded and walked slowly out
of the door, uncertain as to what her next move
should be.</p>
<p>Still thinking deeply, she strolled down the
street until she came within a block of Mrs.
Grace Grant&rsquo;s home. Here a sudden impulse decided
her to visit these relations of Miss Mattie.
If anyone in the world knew about the necklace,
that person would be the trusted nephew, John
Grant.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">[173]</div>
<p>Mary Louise paused a moment in front of the
gate, a little nervous about going in. Suppose
Harry Grant were home alone and he started to
tease her in that familiar way of his! John she
had never seen, except that night on his porch,
in the dark; and of course Mrs. Grant would
be at church.</p>
<p>But the sight of a nice-looking sedan parked
in front of the house reassured her. In all probability
that was John&rsquo;s car, she decided, for it
certainly was not Harry&rsquo;s. Bravely she opened
the gate and walked up to the porch.</p>
<p>She had to wait several minutes before there
was any answer to her ring. Then a middle-aged
man, stout and rather bald, as Elsie had described
John, opened the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this Mr. John Grant?&rdquo; she asked, trying
to make her tone sound business-like.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Mary Louise Gay,&rdquo; she stated. &ldquo;The
girl who found Miss Mattie Grant&rsquo;s money for
her, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John Grant did not know; he shook his head.
Evidently the story had been suppressed by his
mother out of consideration for Harry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t hear about the robbery?&rdquo; she inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. I only know that Aunt Mattie is in the
hospital. My sister&mdash;Mrs. Pearson&mdash;phoned
yesterday. But when was she robbed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you come out on the porch and talk to
me for a few minutes, Mr. Grant?&rdquo; asked Mary
Louise.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">[174]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; he answered, glancing at his
watch. &ldquo;I have to drive to church for Mother
at half-past twelve. But that&rsquo;s over an hour from
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Mr. Grant,&rdquo; said Mary Louise,
as she seated herself in one of the chairs. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t
tell you the whole story&mdash;it&rsquo;s too long. But before
your aunt went to the hospital, all her
money was stolen out of her safe. My chum and
I succeeded in getting most of it back&mdash;all but
a box of gold pieces&mdash;and your aunt put the
money and her bonds into the bank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, when she had to go to the hospital so
suddenly, she became panic-stricken and made
me promise to sleep in her room while she was
away. She had something hidden in her room,
something valuable, but she wouldn&rsquo;t tell me
what it was. I&rsquo;d like to find out just what it was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; demanded the man fearfully. &ldquo;Has
that been taken too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise nodded and briefly told her story
of the mysterious intruder the preceding night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">[175]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It was a ruby necklace,&rdquo; said John. &ldquo;A necklace
someone gave to my grandfather, I believe.
Aunt Mattie didn&rsquo;t know much about how he
got it, but he told her it was very valuable and
that she must guard it above everything else in
the world. So she had it hidden in her straw mattress,
and told me where it was, because it is
willed to me. Nobody else knew anything about
it, to my knowledge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A ruby necklace!&rdquo; repeated Mary Louise.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what the gypsy said it was. I asked a
fortune teller whom our crowd visited yesterday,
and she told me. Claimed it was &lsquo;second
sight&rsquo; on her part.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John Grant laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More likely a rumor she had heard. The
family knew there was something&mdash;I mean Aunt
Mattie&rsquo;s family&mdash;my father and my uncle. But
even they never knew where Grandfather got it
or from whom. There must have been something
queer about it, though, for I understood from
my father that Grandmother wanted him to give
it back. And then, when Aunt Mattie got hold
of it, she kept it hidden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s what Hannah says,&rdquo; agreed Mary
Louise. &ldquo;She says all this disturbance is old Mrs.
Grant&rsquo;s spirit trying to get it back again. But I
can&rsquo;t be expected to believe that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naturally.&rdquo; John smiled, and Mary Louise
thought what a nice, pleasant face he had. No
wonder his aunt Mattie trusted him!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Grant is going to blame Elsie, of
course,&rdquo; continued Mary Louise. &ldquo;She accused
her of stealing the gold pieces.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">[176]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hm!&rdquo; observed John, as if he too thought
the idea possible. &ldquo;Did she take the rest of the
money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, she didn&rsquo;t. We proved that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then who did?&rdquo; inquired John.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I had better not say,&rdquo; answered Mary
Louise. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s over and done with. Your
mother knows&mdash;if you want, you can ask her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John smiled. Mary Louise believed he had
guessed the solution himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t really think Elsie would take the
gold or the necklace, do you, Mr. Grant?&rdquo; she
asked anxiously. &ldquo;Of course, you know her a lot
better than I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. She might argue that she had
a right to some of that money. It wasn&rsquo;t quite
fair that Aunt Mattie got all of Grandfather&rsquo;s
fortune, and Elsie&rsquo;s father didn&rsquo;t get a penny....
Yes, she might take it, while I don&rsquo;t believe
she would ever steal anything else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise shuddered: it seemed as if she
were the only person in the world who still considered
Elsie innocent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a colored family who live down the
hill in back of Dark Cedars. Could they know
about the necklace, Mr. Grant, do you suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">[177]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Abraham Lincoln Jones? Yes, they could
have heard rumors about it&mdash;just as those gypsies
did. But I happen to know that man, and I am
sure he is thoroughly honest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would he steal chickens?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not even chickens.... Of course, his children
might. Colored people love chicken, you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to get Elsie to take me to see
them this afternoon.&rdquo; Mary Louise rose from
her chair. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t take any more of your time,
Mr. Grant&mdash;unless you can tell me what to do.
I don&rsquo;t like to go to the police without Miss
Grant&rsquo;s consent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I wouldn&rsquo;t do that. If there is something
queer about her possession of the necklace,
it would be better for her to lose it than to
have an old disgrace exposed. At Aunt Mattie&rsquo;s
age, I mean. We better wait until she gets
well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise nodded: that was exactly her
idea too. Unless, of course, one of the family
had taken it&mdash;Corinne Pearson or Harry Grant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I guess it would be all right to speak to
Daddy in confidence about it,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and
get his advice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. He is Detective Gay, of the police
force. You&rsquo;ve heard of him?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">[178]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, certainly. But tell him not to bring
in the police&mdash;yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise held out her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you so much, Mr. Grant, for giving
me your time,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get in touch with
you later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well satisfied with her interview, she left the
Grants&rsquo; porch and determined to do a little more
investigating for herself before she consulted
her father. A little farther down the street was
the home of Bernice Tracey, an attractive young
woman of about twenty-five, who had once
been a lieutenant in Mary Louise&rsquo;s Girl Scout
troop. To this girl she decided to go for some
information concerning Corinne Pearson, for
she knew that Miss Tracey was a member of the
Country Club set.</p>
<p>Miss Tracey herself answered Mary Louise&rsquo;s
ring at the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Mary Lou!&rdquo; she exclaimed in surprise.
&ldquo;You are a stranger! And you almost caught
me in bed, too! I just finished my breakfast.
Come in&mdash;or shall I come out on the porch?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I can only stay a minute, Miss Tracey,&rdquo;
replied Mary Louise. &ldquo;I just wanted to ask you
a couple of questions, if you don&rsquo;t mind....
And please don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m crazy.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">[179]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know there never was a girl with a more
level head on her shoulders!&rdquo; answered the other
admiringly. &ldquo;Go ahead and ask me the questions,
Mary Lou.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;er&mdash;you went to that dance last night,
didn&rsquo;t you, with the Country Club people? Was
Corinne Pearson there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, she and Ned Mason ate supper with
us. Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t ask me why! What time did the
dance begin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About eleven o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise frowned; it was possible, then,
that Corinne could have been at Dark Cedars
a little after ten.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And&mdash;and&mdash;can you remember what Miss
Pearson wore?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. A white organdie. It was very simple,
but awfully nice for a summer dance. I wish
I had been as sensible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now for the final question! Mary Louise had
to summon all her courage to put forth this one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you remember what kind of jewelry she
had on? What color?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Tracey&rsquo;s face lighted up with a smile.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">[180]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know why you&rsquo;re asking me these questions,
Mary Lou!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a
society reporter on the <i>Star</i>&mdash;aren&rsquo;t you? But I
don&rsquo;t see why you don&rsquo;t ask me what I wore.
Aren&rsquo;t I as pretty and as important as Corinne
Pearson?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re twice as important and five times as
pretty, Miss Tracey!&rdquo; replied Mary Louise instantly.
&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not a reporter-or even trying
to become one.... I&rsquo;ll explain some time later....
Just tell me about the jewelry, if you can
remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, my dear. Corinne wore red with
her white dress. Imitation rubies, I suppose.
Earrings and necklace and two bracelets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; gasped Mary Louise. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I
want to know. Thank you, Miss Tracey, thank
you just heaps!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">[181]</div>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="small">Chapter XIV</span>
<br /><i>Bad News</i></h2>
<p>Mary Louise&rsquo;s first impulse, upon leaving Miss
Tracey&rsquo;s home, was to rush right over to Corinne
Pearson with a demand to see the necklace which
she had worn at the dance the night before. But
she had not taken more than a few steps before
she saw the foolishness of such a proceeding. In
the first place, Corinne would not be likely to
show her the necklace; in the second place, Mary
Louise could tell nothing by examining it. She
wasn&rsquo;t a connoisseur in rubies; it was doubtful
whether she could spot a real stone if she saw
one. No, nothing was to be gained by a visit to
the Pearsons&rsquo; at this time.</p>
<p>So instead she directed her course towards
home, resolving to discuss the whole affair with
her father, if he had returned from his business
trip, as her mother had expected.</p>
<p>She found him on the porch, reading the
Sunday paper and smoking his pipe. He was a
big man with a determined chin and fine dark
eyes which lighted up with joy at the sight of
his daughter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">[182]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mary Lou!&rdquo; he exclaimed, getting up out
of his chair and kissing her. &ldquo;I was so afraid
you wouldn&rsquo;t be home to see me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just had to see you, Daddy,&rdquo; returned the
girl. &ldquo;I need your help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down, dear. Your mother tells me that
you are engaged in some serious business. I feel
very proud of my detective daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m not so good after all,&rdquo; she
replied sadly. &ldquo;Now that I&rsquo;m really up against a
hard problem, I don&rsquo;t know which way to turn.
I&rsquo;d like to tell you about it, if you have time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She seated herself in the hammock and took
off her hat. It was lovely and cool on the shaded
porch after the heat of the Riverside streets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I have time,&rdquo; Mr. Gay assured
her. &ldquo;Begin at the beginning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will, Daddy. Only, first of all, you must
promise not to tell anybody&mdash;except Mother,
of course. Miss Grant seems to dread publicity
of any kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The reason she gives is that she firmly believes
some member of her own family to be
guilty and wants to avoid scandal. But I think
there&rsquo;s another&mdash;a deeper reason.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what do you think that is, Mary Lou?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">[183]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A desire to keep her possession of a ruby
necklace a secret. She kept it hidden in the mattress
of her bed and never mentioned it to anybody
except one trusted nephew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Gay wrinkled his brows. &ldquo;I guess you
had better tell me the facts in order, dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise settled herself more comfortably
in the hammock, and told her story, just as
everything had happened. When she finally
came to the description of the robbery the previous
night, and of her own shameful treatment
at the hands of the thief, her father cried out in
resentment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell Mother about my being bound up
and put in the closet,&rdquo; she begged. &ldquo;It would
worry her sick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It worries me sick!&rdquo; announced Mr. Gay.
&ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t want you to spend another night
at that dreadful place.... In fact, I forbid
it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise nodded: she had been expecting
the command.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then may I bring Elsie Grant home with
me while her aunt is in the hospital?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I suppose so&mdash;if your mother is willing.&rdquo;
But his consent was rather reluctant; Mary
Louise sensed his distrust of the orphan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Daddy, do you think Elsie is guilty?&rdquo; she
asked immediately.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">[184]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to think. You believe that
your intruder was a woman, don&rsquo;t you? Then,
if it was a woman in Miss Grant&rsquo;s family, how
many possible suspects have you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise checked them off on her fingers.
&ldquo;Old Mrs. Grant, Mrs. Pearson, Corinne Pearson&mdash;and
Elsie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which are most likely to have heard about
the necklace? Old Mrs. Grant and Elsie, I
should say, offhand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; agreed his daughter. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m sure
Mrs. Grace Grant wouldn&rsquo;t steal. Besides, she&rsquo;s
too old to get down a ladder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on a minute!&rdquo; cautioned her father.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not sure that your thief got away in
that manner. Suppose, as you are inclined to believe,
she was at Dark Cedars when you arrived
last night, and suppose she did hide in the closet
until she thought you were asleep. When she
finished her job, why couldn&rsquo;t she have walked
down the stairs and out the door&mdash;it must unlock
from the inside&mdash;while you were still locked
in the closet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true. But wouldn&rsquo;t Elsie have heard
her?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">[185]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Probably. But, then, she&rsquo;d have been likely
to hear anybody getting out of a window....
Yes, I think suspicion points to the young girl,
with one possible exception.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean Corinne Pearson?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t. I think the very fact that she
wore a red necklace to the dance practically
proves her innocence. If she even knew her aunt
owned a ruby necklace, she wouldn&rsquo;t have done
that, after she was caught in another theft.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise sighed: she felt as if her visit
to Miss Tracey had been wasted time, and she
said as much to her father. But he reassured her
with the statement that real detectives make
many such visits, which may seem to lead to
nothing, but which all have their part in leading
to the capture of the criminal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then whom else do you suspect, Daddy?&rdquo;
she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The most obvious person of all. The person
who had every reason to believe that there was
something valuable hidden in Miss Grant&rsquo;s
bed from the way the old lady guarded it. The
person who made up all the stories about ghosts
to throw you girls off the track. I mean Hannah,
of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hannah!&rdquo; repeated Mary Louise in amazement.
She had never thought of her as guilty
since her interview with her that very first day.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">[186]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You may be right, Daddy. But if she was
going to steal, why did she do it at night, when
we were there? She had plenty of chance all day
alone at Dark Cedars&mdash;except for William, her
husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but then you would immediately suspect
her or William. This threw you off the
track.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise pondered the matter seriously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I still can&rsquo;t believe that, Daddy. Knowing
Hannah as I do, I would stake my word on the
fact that both she and old Mrs. Grant are absolutely
honest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it may not have been a member of the
family at all,&rdquo; observed Mr. Gay. &ldquo;Maybe it
was an outsider, someone who had heard a rumor
about the necklace and visited the house
systematically at night, searching for it. That
would account for those strange noises and the
disturbances. It might even have been the person
who owned the necklace in the first place, who
would know, of course, that it was still at Dark
Cedars. There is only one thing to do that I can
see, and that is to notify the pawnshops and
jewelers all over the country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that would take forever,&rdquo; protested Mary
Louise. &ldquo;And besides, we couldn&rsquo;t mention Miss
Grant&rsquo;s name without her permission.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">[187]</div>
<p>Mr. Gay smiled; there was a great deal for
Mary Louise to learn about the detective business.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t take any time at all,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;The police have a list of all such places and a
method of communication. And Miss Grant&rsquo;s
name need not be mentioned&mdash;my name is sufficient.
But I wish we could get a more accurate
description of the necklace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish we could. I&rsquo;ll try to see Miss Grant
again tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t make so much difference, however,&rdquo;
her father told her. &ldquo;If the rubies are real,
they can easily be detected. It isn&rsquo;t likely that
many ruby necklaces are being pawned at the
same time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you do this for me, Daddy?&rdquo; asked
Mary Louise, rising from the hammock and
opening the screen door. &ldquo;I just want to say
&lsquo;hello&rsquo; to Mother, and then I must be on my
way. I&rsquo;m due back at Dark Cedars at two
o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Gay frowned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must you go, dear? I don&rsquo;t forbid it, in
broad daylight, but I don&rsquo;t like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I must get my suitcase, Daddy. And
bring Elsie back, if she wants to come.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">[188]</div>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Mary Lou. I&rsquo;ll drive you over, if
our dinner isn&rsquo;t ready. And I&rsquo;ll come back for
you about five o&rsquo;clock, so that I&rsquo;m sure of getting
you home here safely before dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a simple matter for Mary Louise to
gain her mother&rsquo;s consent to bring Elsie Grant
home with her. Believing the girl to be just a
poor downtrodden orphan, Mrs. Gay adopted
a motherly, sympathetic attitude, totally unaware
that both Jane Patterson and Mr. Gay
suspected the girl of the crime. She was delighted
that her daughter had decided to leave
Dark Cedars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s bad enough to have your father away on
dangerous work, without having to worry about
you too, Mary Louise,&rdquo; she said as she kissed
her daughter good-bye. &ldquo;Be back in time for
supper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; promised the girl. &ldquo;Daddy is going
to drive me over and come back for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the short ride in her father&rsquo;s car the
theft was not mentioned. If possible, Mary
Louise wanted to forget it for the time being.
She hated to go to Dark Cedars and eat Hannah&rsquo;s
dinner as Elsie&rsquo;s guest and all the while
suspect one or the other of them of a horrible
crime.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">[189]</div>
<p>Mr. Gay left Mary Louise at the hedge, and
she ran up the path lightly, just like an ordinary
girl visiting one of her chums for a Sunday dinner.
But Elsie did not come out to meet her, and
she had to knock on the door to gain admittance.</p>
<p>In a minute or two Hannah answered it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t Elsie with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. She said she&rsquo;d stay and help you,&rdquo; she
replied. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t she tell you about what happened
last night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Hannah&rsquo;s eyes opened wide. &ldquo;Was the
spirits here again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody was here,&rdquo; answered Mary
Louise. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you been up in Miss Grant&rsquo;s
room?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I ain&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;ve been too busy out in the
garden helpin&rsquo; William and gettin&rsquo; dinner ready.
I figured you girls&rsquo;d make your own bed. Elsie
always did most of the upstairs work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I couldn&rsquo;t very easily make the first
bed I slept in,&rdquo; remarked Mary Louise. &ldquo;Because
the mattress was torn to pieces.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Mattie&rsquo;s?&rdquo; gasped Hannah, in genuine
terror. She looked so frightened that Mary
Louise could not believe she was acting.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">[190]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Somebody bound and gagged me and
locked me in the closet and then proceeded to
strip the bed. They must have found Miss
Grant&rsquo;s precious necklace&mdash;for that&rsquo;s what it
was, John Grant said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The servant woman bowed her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May the Lord have mercy on us!&rdquo; she said
reverently. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s His way of punishin&rsquo; Miss Mattie
fer keepin&rsquo; the thing her dead mother warned
her agin&rsquo;.&rdquo; She looked up at Mary Louise. &ldquo;Eat
your dinner quick,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Then let&rsquo;s get
out of here, before the spirits come agin!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where&rsquo;s Elsie?&rdquo; insisted Mary Louise,
knowing that it was no use to argue with Hannah
about the &ldquo;spirits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She went off soon after you girls left. I
thought she changed her mind and went to
Sunday school. She had on her green silk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And hasn&rsquo;t she come back all morning?&rdquo; demanded
Mary Louise in dismay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nary a sign of her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise groaned. This was bad news&mdash;just
what she had been fearing ever since her
conversations with Jane and with her father. If
Elsie had run away, there could be only one
reason for her going: she must be guilty!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had better go right home and see my
father,&rdquo; she said nervously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">[191]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You set right down and eat your dinner, Miss
Mary Louise!&rdquo; commanded Hannah. &ldquo;You need
food&mdash;and it&rsquo;s right here. You ain&rsquo;t a-goin&rsquo; to
take no hot walk on an empty stomach! Besides,
Elsie may come in any minute. She probably
run down to show them colored people her pretty
green dress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise&rsquo;s eyes brightened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Abraham Lincoln Jones&rsquo;s family?&rdquo; she inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah. Elsie&rsquo;s awful fond of them. They kind
of pet her up, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise smiled and sat down to her dinner.
The food tasted good, for it was fresh from
the garden, and Hannah was an excellent cook.
But all the time she was eating she kept her eyes
on the door, watching, almost praying that Elsie
would come in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you had better not touch that room
of Miss Grant&rsquo;s,&rdquo; she cautioned Hannah. &ldquo;I
think it might be better to leave it just as it is&mdash;for
the sake of evidence. My clothes are in
your old room now, and I&rsquo;ll get them from
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you worry!&rdquo; returned the woman, with
a frightened look in her eyes. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t givin&rsquo; no
spirits no chance at me! I&rsquo;m leavin&rsquo; the minute
these dishes is done, and I ain&rsquo;t comin&rsquo; back day
or night. If Elsie ain&rsquo;t home by the time I
go, you can take the key, Miss Mary Louise,
and turn it over to Miss Mattie.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">[192]</div>
<p>Mary Louise nodded: perhaps this was for
the best.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave my suitcase on the porch while I
run down to see the Jones family,&rdquo; she said, as
she finished her apple pie. &ldquo;And you had better
clear out the refrigerator and take all the food
that is left, because, if I find Elsie, I&rsquo;ll take her
home with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe she&rsquo;s havin&rsquo; a chicken dinner with
them colored people,&rdquo; returned Hannah and for
the first time since Mary Louise&rsquo;s arrival she
smiled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">[193]</div>
<h2 id="c15"><span class="small">CHAPTER XV</span>
<br /><i>An Alibi</i></h2>
<p>The wooden shack where the Jones family
lived was picturesque in its setting among the
cedar trees behind Miss Grant&rsquo;s home. In summer
time Mary Louise could understand living
very comfortably in such a place. But, isolated
as it was, and probably poorly heated, it must
be terribly cold in winter.</p>
<p>She ran down the hill gayly, humming a tune
to herself and smiling, for she did not want the
colored family to think that her visit was anything
but a friendly one. As she came to a clearing
among the cedar trees she saw two nicely
dressed children playing outside the shack and
singing at the top of their lungs. They beamed
at Mary Louise genially and went on with their
song.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you children know Miss Elsie Grant?&rdquo;
she shouted.</p>
<p>They both nodded immediately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure we know her! You a friend o&rsquo; hers?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">[194]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Mary Louise. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been
visiting her, up at her aunt&rsquo;s place. But she
didn&rsquo;t come home for dinner, so I thought maybe
she was here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, ma&rsquo;am, she ain&rsquo;t,&rdquo; replied the older
child. &ldquo;You-all want to see Ma?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I should like to. If she isn&rsquo;t busy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ma!&rdquo; yelled both children at once, and a
pleasant-faced colored woman appeared at the
door of the shack. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a frien&rsquo; of Miz Elsie&rsquo;s!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman smiled. &ldquo;Come in, Honey,&rdquo; she
invited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just wanted to ask you whether you had seen
Miss Elsie this morning,&rdquo; said Mary Louise.</p>
<p>Mrs. Jones opened the bright-blue screen door
and motioned her caller into her house. There
were only two rooms in the shack, but Mary
Louise could see immediately how beautifully
neat they were, although the color combinations
made her want to laugh out loud. A purple door
curtain separated the one room from the other,
and some of the chairs were red plush, some
brown leather, and one a bright green. But there
was mosquito netting tacked up at the windows,
and the linoleum-covered floor was spotless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Set down, Honey,&rdquo; urged the woman, and
Mary Louise selected a red-plush chair. She repeated
her question about Elsie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes and no,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Jones indefinitely.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">[195]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by &lsquo;yes and no,&rsquo; Mrs.
Jones?&rdquo; inquired Mary Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw her but didn&rsquo;t have no talk wid her,&rdquo;
explained the other. &ldquo;She was all dressed up in
a fine dress and had a bundle unde&rsquo; her arm. I
reckoned she was comin&rsquo; down to visit us, but
she done go off through de woods. Why you ask,
Honey? She ain&rsquo;t lost, am she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t come back for dinner,&rdquo; answered
Mary Louise. &ldquo;So Hannah and I were worried.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Jones rolled her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Runned away, I reckon. Miz Grant didn&rsquo;t
treat her good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Miss Grant isn&rsquo;t there&mdash;she&rsquo;s in the hospital.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and I wanted to take Elsie home with
me while she was away. So you wouldn&rsquo;t think
she&rsquo;d want to run away now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you wouldn&rsquo;t. Not when she&rsquo;s got a nice
friend like you, Honey. Mebbe she was kidnaped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody would want to kidnap Elsie Grant.
She&rsquo;s too poor&mdash;and her aunt would never pay
ransom money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Jones chuckled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">[196]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You right &rsquo;bout dat, Honey, fo&rsquo; sure. Miz
Grant&rsquo;s de stingiest white woman eve&rsquo; lived.
Wouldn&rsquo;t give away a bone to a dog if she could
help he&rsquo;self. Served her right &rsquo;bout dem chickens!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise turned sharply. &ldquo;Chickens?&rdquo; she
repeated, trying to keep her voice calm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Her chickens is bein&rsquo; stolen all de time.
Half a dozen to oncet&mdash;and me and Abraham
won&rsquo;t lift a finger to put a stop to it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know who has been taking them?&rdquo; asked
Mary Louise incredulously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We knows fo&rsquo; sure, Honey. But we ain&rsquo;t
tellin&rsquo; no tales to Miz Grant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose she accuses your husband?&rdquo; suggested
Mary Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dat&rsquo;s sumpin&rsquo; diff&rsquo;rent. Den we&rsquo;d tell. But
it&rsquo;d be safe enough by dat time. De gypsies has
wandered off by now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gypsies!&rdquo; exclaimed Mary Louise. &ldquo;Did
they steal the chickens?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dey sure did. We could see &rsquo;em, sneakin&rsquo; up
at night, by de light of de moon. If Miz Grant
eve&rsquo; catched &rsquo;em, it&rsquo;d sure go right bad wid &rsquo;em.
She hates &rsquo;em like pison.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you think the gypsies have gone away,
Mrs. Jones?&rdquo; questioned Mary Louise.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">[197]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon so, or dey&rsquo;d be stealin&rsquo; mo&rsquo; chickens.
But we ain&rsquo;t seen nor heard &rsquo;em fo&rsquo; several
nights. Guess dey done cleaned out of de neighborhood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise cleared her throat. She wanted
to ask this woman what she knew about the robbery
at Dark Cedars, but she did not like to
seem abrupt or suspicious. So she tried to speak
casually.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since you know about the chickens being
stolen, Mrs. Jones, did you happen to hear anything
unusual last night at Dark Cedars?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lem&rsquo;me see.... Las&rsquo; night was Sattiday,
wasn&rsquo;t it? Abraham done gone to lodge meetin&rsquo;
and got home bout ten o&rsquo;clock, he said. No, I
was in bed asleep, and we neve&rsquo; wakened up at
all.... Why? Did anything happen up there?
Mo&rsquo; chickens took?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not chickens&mdash;but something a great deal
more valuable. A piece of jewelry belonging to
Miss Grant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say! Was dere real stones in it&mdash;genu-ine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The colored woman shook her head solemnly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">[198]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Abraham always say de old lady&rsquo;d come to
trouble sure as night follows day. De mean life
she&rsquo;s done lived&mdash;neve&rsquo; goin&rsquo; to church or helpin&rsquo;
de poor. She neve&rsquo; sent us so much as a bucket
of coal fo&rsquo; Christmas. But we don&rsquo;t judge her&mdash;dat&rsquo;s
de Lord&rsquo;s business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you know she kept money and jewels in
her house?&rdquo; inquired Mary Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. It warn&rsquo;t none of our business. Abraham
ain&rsquo;t interested in folks&rsquo; money&mdash;only in
der souls. He&rsquo;s a deacon in Rive&rsquo;side Colored
Church, you know!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve heard him very highly spoken of,
Mrs. Jones,&rdquo; concluded Mary Louise, rising
from her chair. &ldquo;If you see Elsie, will you tell
her to come to our house? Anybody can direct
her where to find the Gays&rsquo; home, in Riverside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sure will, Miz Gay. Dat&rsquo;s a perty name....
And you a perty gal!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; stammered Mary Louise in embarrassment....
&ldquo;And good-bye, Mrs. Jones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stepped out of the shack and waved to the
children as she passed them again on her way
back to Dark Cedars. Glancing at her watch as
she climbed the hill, she observed that it was only
half-past three. What in the world would she do
to pass the time until her father came for her
at five o&rsquo;clock?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">[199]</div>
<p>It occurred to her as she approached Miss
Grant&rsquo;s house that she might try to interview
Hannah concerning her whereabouts the preceding
night, and she was thankful to catch
sight of the woman in the back yard, talking to
William, her husband. It was evident from both
the old servants&rsquo; attitudes that they were having
an argument, and Mary Louise approached
slowly, not wishing to interrupt.</p>
<p>William Groben looked much older than his
wife, although Hannah was by no means a young
woman. Hadn&rsquo;t she claimed that she had done
the house-cleaning for forty years at Dark Cedars?
Even if she had begun to work there in
her teens, Mary Louise figured that she must be
fast approaching sixty. But William looked
well over seventy. He was thin and shriveled and
bent; what little hair he had left was absolutely
white. There could be no doubt about William&rsquo;s
innocence in the whole affair at Dark Cedars: a
frail old man like that could not have managed
to handle a healthy girl like Mary Louise in
the manner in which the criminal had treated
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t no use sayin&rsquo; another word, Hannah,&rdquo;
Mary Louise heard William announce
stubbornly. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t a-goin&rsquo; a-change me mind.
Duty is duty, and I always say if a man can&rsquo;t
be faithful to his employer&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">[200]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard that before, never mind repeatin&rsquo;
it!&rdquo; snapped his wife. &ldquo;And nobody can say I
ain&rsquo;t been faithful to Miss Mattie, fer all her
crankiness. But we&rsquo;ve got a little bit saved up,
and we can manage to live on it, with my sister
Jennie, without you workin&rsquo; here. In a place
that&rsquo;s haunted by spirits!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man looked up sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long do you think four hundred dollars
would keep us?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;Besides,
it&rsquo;s invested for us&mdash;to bury us. You can&rsquo;t touch
that, Hannah. No, I want me regular wages. I
like good victuals!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I. But what&rsquo;s the use of good victuals
if you&rsquo;re half scared of your life all the time?
I&rsquo;ll never step inside that there house again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>William shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do as you&rsquo;re a mind to, Hannah&mdash;you always
have. And I&rsquo;ll go on livin&rsquo; over to Jennie&rsquo;s
with you. But I&rsquo;m still workin&rsquo; here in the daytime.
I couldn&rsquo;t let them chickens starve and
the garden go to seed. And what would become
of the cow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You could sell her and turn the money over
to Miss Mattie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>William smiled sarcastically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And have her half kill me for doin&rsquo; it? Not
me! Besides, it wouldn&rsquo;t be fair to the poor old
lady in the hospital. Dependin&rsquo; on me as she is.
No, siree! Duty is duty, and I always say&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">[201]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo; yelled Hannah in exasperation.
And then, all of a sudden, she spied Mary
Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you never get married, Miss Mary
Louise,&rdquo; she advised. &ldquo;I never seen a man that
wasn&rsquo;t too stubborn to reason with. Did you
find Elsie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Mrs. Jones saw her cutting across the
woods this morning. But she didn&rsquo;t stop there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess she must have them gold pieces of her
aunt Mattie&rsquo;s after all, and took her chance to
clear out when the clearin&rsquo; was good. Can&rsquo;t
say as I blame her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise sighed: that was the logical
conclusion for everybody to come to.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I think I&rsquo;ll go home now, Hannah,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t wait for my father to come for
me. And shall I take the key, or will William
want to keep it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You take it,&rdquo; urged the old man. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
want to feel responsible for it. My duty&rsquo;s outside
the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hannah handed it over with a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m that glad to get rid of it! And you tell
Miss Mattie that I&rsquo;m livin&rsquo; at my sister Jennie&rsquo;s.
I&rsquo;ll write the address down for you, if you&rsquo;ve got
your little book handy.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">[202]</div>
<p>Mary Louise gladly produced it from her
pocket: this was easy&mdash;getting Hannah&rsquo;s address
without even asking for it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this where you were last night?&rdquo; she inquired
casually, as the woman wrote down the
street and number.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. At least, except while we was at the
movies. My sister Jennie made William go with
us&mdash;he never thought he cared about them before.
But you ought to see him laugh at Laurel
and Hardy. I thought I&rsquo;d die, right there in the
Globe Theater.&rdquo;</p>
<p>William grinned at the recollection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They was funny,&rdquo; he agreed. &ldquo;When the
show was over, I just set there, still laughin&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They almost closed the theater on us,&rdquo; remarked
Hannah. &ldquo;It was half-past eleven when
we got home, and that&rsquo;s late for us, even of a
Saturday night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise chuckled. She couldn&rsquo;t have
gotten any information more easily if she had
been a real detective. Yet here was a perfect
alibi for Hannah; if she had been at the movies
until half-past eleven, she couldn&rsquo;t have stolen
that necklace from Dark Cedars. Maybe that
bit of detective work wouldn&rsquo;t make an impression
upon her father!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">[203]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, I can check up on it at the Globe
Theater,&rdquo; she decided in her most professional
manner.</p>
<p>She held out her hand to Hannah.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s good-bye, then, Hannah&mdash;and thank you
for all the nice things you cooked for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome, Miss Mary Louise. And if
you come over to see me at my sister Jennie&rsquo;s,
I&rsquo;ll make some doughnuts for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be there!&rdquo; promised the girl, and with
a nod to William, she went around to the porch
to get her suitcase.</p>
<p>Thankful that it was not heavy, she walked
slowly down to the road and on to Riverside.
She had plenty of chance to think as she went
along, but her thoughts were not pleasant. Hannah&rsquo;s
alibi only made Elsie&rsquo;s guilt seem more
assured. And how she hated to have to tell her
father and Jane of the girl&rsquo;s disappearance!
There was bound to be publicity now, for the
newspapers&rsquo; help would have to be enlisted in
the search for the missing orphan. Miss Grant
would have to know the whole story, including
the theft of the necklace....</p>
<p>Mary Louise shuddered, hoping that she
would not be the bearer of the evil tidings to
the sick old lady.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">[204]</div>
<h2 id="c16"><span class="small">Chapter XVI</span>
<br /><i>Spreading the Net</i></h2>
<p>Mary Louise spied Norman Wilder&rsquo;s car in
front of Jane Patterson&rsquo;s house as she turned into
her own street in Riverside; a moment later she
recognized both Norman and Max on her
chum&rsquo;s porch. As soon as they, in their turn, saw
her, they rushed down to the gate to meet her,
and Max seized her suitcase.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you wouldn&rsquo;t be so doggone independent,&rdquo;
he exclaimed, &ldquo;and just let a fellow know when
you needed a lift, Mary Lou, I&rsquo;d have driven
over for you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, Max,&rdquo; returned Mary
Louise. &ldquo;As a matter of fact, Dad was coming
for me at five o&rsquo;clock, but I didn&rsquo;t want to wait
that long. There was nothing to do at Dark
Cedars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing to do?&rdquo; echoed Jane. &ldquo;Are you going
to stay home now and leave Elsie all alone?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">[205]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Dad wants me home,&rdquo; was all the explanation
Mary Louise would make before the boys.
Later, she would tell her chum about the girl&rsquo;s
disappearance. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to go right in now,&rdquo; she
added. &ldquo;After I have a bath and my supper, I&rsquo;ll
join you people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After supper!&rdquo; repeated Max in disgust. &ldquo;We
were just considering a little picnic in the woods.
It&rsquo;s a marvelous day for a swim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Picnic? Why, we had one yesterday!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it was such fun that we thought we&rsquo;d
have an encore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I have too much to do to be in on
any picnic,&rdquo; answered Mary Louise. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll go
for a walk or a drive with you all after supper&mdash;maybe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seeing that she was firm in her resolve, the
young people released her, and she hurried into
her own house. Mr. Gay was standing in the
living room, holding the keys to his car in his
hand and trying to persuade his wife to drive
over to Dark Cedars with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Mary Lou!&rdquo; he exclaimed in surprise.
&ldquo;We were just getting ready to go for you. Why
didn&rsquo;t you wait for me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where is Elsie?&rdquo; inquired Mrs. Gay.
Mary Louise dropped despondently into a
chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&mdash;went away,&rdquo; she replied briefly.</p>
<p>Mr. Gay turned sharply. &ldquo;Where?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>Mary Louise shook her head.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">[206]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Hannah said she went out soon
after Jane and I left for Sunday school this
morning, and the colored woman who lives in
back of Dark Cedars saw her go through the
woods. But she didn&rsquo;t come back in time for dinner&mdash;or
at all, before I left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The poor child is lost!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Gay
sympathetically. &ldquo;If she wandered into Cooper&rsquo;s
woods, it&rsquo;s no wonder.&rdquo; She turned to her husband.
&ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t we better get out a searching
party, dear, immediately? The Boy and the Girl
Scouts, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Gay frowned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my dear,&rdquo; he replied slowly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
think Elsie Grant is lost. Neither does Mary
Lou. I&rsquo;m afraid she&rsquo;s headed straight for Harrisburg&mdash;and
may have arrived by this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Harrisburg?&rdquo; repeated Mrs. Gay. &ldquo;Why,
that&rsquo;s sixty miles away! She couldn&rsquo;t walk that
far.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t expect her to walk. I think she
took the train&mdash;not from Riverside, but from the
next station.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could she take a train? She couldn&rsquo;t
buy a ticket, for she hasn&rsquo;t any money.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">[207]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We are afraid, my dear, that Elsie Grant has
plenty of money, though she may encounter a
little difficulty in spending it, since the new law
was passed. We believe that she stole those gold
pieces from her aunt&mdash;and last night a necklace
was taken, so it looks as if she had that too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How terrible!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Gay, looking
at Mary Louise as if she expected her to protest,
or at least explain, her father&rsquo;s accusation. But
the girl was sitting disconsolately with her head
bowed, as if she believed that every word was
true.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall we do, Daddy?&rdquo; Mary Louise
asked finally, in a hopeless tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Notify the railroad stations to be on watch
for a girl of Elsie&rsquo;s description, who probably
tried to buy a ticket with a gold piece. Of course,
it&rsquo;s possible she may have stolen some change
from her aunt&rsquo;s pocketbook and used that for
carfare.... Do you happen to know what kind
of dress she was wearing, Mary Lou?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My green silk&mdash;with little flowers in it. I
gave it to her.&rdquo; The reply was almost a sob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll attend to that part, then,&rdquo; announced Mr.
Gay. &ldquo;And you will have to go over to see Mr.
John Grant, Mary Lou, and tell him that Elsie
has gone. It will be up to him to take charge of
the affair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose he doesn&rsquo;t want the police notified
that Elsie is missing?&rdquo; asked his daughter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">[208]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t his place to decide that question. If
a person is missing, it&rsquo;s the law&rsquo;s duty to step in
and try to find him or her. The loss of the necklace
is a different matter, which concerns the
Grant family alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise nodded and picked up her suitcase.
She wanted to be alone in her own room;
she felt too miserable to talk to anybody&mdash;even
her father. What would be the use of telling him
about her interview with Mrs. Jones, or the establishment
of Hannah Groben&rsquo;s alibi? He no
longer entertained any suspicions about these
people: the finger of accusation pointed too
surely at Elsie Grant.</p>
<p>Taking off her hat and her dress, Mary Louise
threw herself down upon the bed. How tired she
was! And how discouraged! How dreadful it
was to believe in somebody and to have that trust
betrayed! Elsie Grant had appeared to be such
a sweet, innocent person, so worthy of sympathy.
It didn&rsquo;t seem possible that while she was accepting
the girls&rsquo; friendship and their gifts she
could be plotting this wicked thing.</p>
<p>The laughter of Mary Louise&rsquo;s young friends
rose from the porch next door and came through
the open window, but the weary girl on the bed
had no desire to join them. For once in her life
she felt as if she wanted to avoid Jane. She
couldn&rsquo;t bear to tell her that her suspicions about
Elsie had been as good as proved.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">[209]</div>
<p>Tired and unhappy, Mary Louise closed her
eyes, and before she realized it she was fast
asleep. The experience of the previous night
and the strain of this day had overpowered her,
and for an hour she forgot all her troubles in a
dreamless rest. Her mother wakened her by announcing
that supper was on the table.</p>
<p>Mary Louise sat up and rubbed her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Mother,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I meant to
help you. I haven&rsquo;t been much use to you for
the last few days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, dear,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Gay.
&ldquo;You needed the sleep, and Freckles has been
fine.... Now, come to supper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise was delighted to find that she
felt much better after her nap. And much more
cheerful. She no longer dreaded the coming necessary
interview with John Grant, which she
meant to seek after supper.</p>
<p>However, she was saved the trouble of going
to his house, for scarcely had the Gays finished
eating when John Grant arrived. Mary Louise
and her father received him in the living room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a message for you, Miss Gay,&rdquo; he announced,
&ldquo;from my aunt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; exclaimed Mary Louise. &ldquo;You were
able to see her, then?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">[210]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Late this afternoon. She seemed much better
and asked the nurse to send for me. So I went
over to the hospital about five o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you tell her about the necklace?&rdquo; asked
Mary Louise eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I did. I thought it would be best to get
it over with. She asked me whether it was safe,
and I couldn&rsquo;t lie. So I told her what happened
last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise gasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t the shock too much for her? And
wasn&rsquo;t she just furious at me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, she stood it quite well. She said she knew
something had happened because of a dream she
had last night. And she said, &lsquo;Tell Mary Louise
not to worry, because I don&rsquo;t blame her. And I
want to see her myself tomorrow morning.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that&rsquo;s wonderful!&rdquo; exclaimed the girl,
with a sigh of relief. &ldquo;I had no idea she would
take it so well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither did I,&rdquo; admitted John. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
something queer about it&mdash;but maybe she&rsquo;ll explain
tomorrow. I wasn&rsquo;t allowed to stay with
her long today, and she was too weak to talk
much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Mr. Gay who put the question that was
trembling on Mary Louise&rsquo;s lips:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does she think her niece&mdash;Elsie Grant, I
mean&mdash;stole the necklace?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">[211]</div>
<p>&ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t say,&rdquo; answered John. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t
believe so, because she asked whether Elsie
had confessed yet about the gold pieces. That
wouldn&rsquo;t indicate that she believed her guilty
of another theft.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it wouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; agreed Mr. Gay. &ldquo;But
everything points that way. We have bad news
for you, Mr. Grant: Elsie has disappeared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo;</p>
<p>John Grant&rsquo;s grunt and his nod were significant.
&ldquo;I was afraid of that,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have already notified the police,&rdquo; announced
Mr. Gay. &ldquo;They are watching for her
at the railroad stations, and I have wired the
pawnshops and jewelers in Harrisburg and other
cities nearby. We&rsquo;ll probably catch her by tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; sighed John. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too bad. I feel
sort of guilty about the whole thing. If we had
taken the child into our home, instead of letting
her go with Aunt Mattie, it would never have
happened. But we were feeling the depression
and didn&rsquo;t see how we could assume any more
expense. My brother isn&rsquo;t earning anything, and
Mother lost most of her inheritance. While Aunt
Mattie, of course, had plenty.... But it was a
mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">[212]</div>
<p>Mary Louise looked gratefully at the man:
John Grant was the only person besides herself
who felt any pity for Elsie. How she wished he
had been able to bring her up!... But it was
too late now for regrets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will be done with her when they do
find her?&rdquo; she inquired tremulously. &ldquo;Will she
be sent to prison if she is proved guilty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>John shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will be for Aunt Mattie to decide. But
you know she has talked nothing but reform
school since the child came to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe I can persuade her to give Elsie another
chance,&rdquo; murmured Mary Louise hopefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; agreed John as he shook hands with
Mr. Gay and departed.</p>
<p>Mary Louise turned to her father after the
man left.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have some things to tell you, Daddy,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;Some clues I followed up this afternoon.
Do you want to hear them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By all means,&rdquo; returned Mr. Gay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One thing I learned is that the gypsies stole
those chickens. At least&mdash;the wife of the colored
man who lives in back of Dark Cedars claims
that they did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Gay smiled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">[213]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s important?&rdquo; asked
Mary Louise in disappointment, for she could
read his thought. &ldquo;It occurred to me that, if they
stole the chickens, maybe it was they who stole
the necklace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid not, daughter. If we have only a
colored woman&rsquo;s word for it, that&rsquo;s no proof.
She&rsquo;s probably shielding herself or her husband....
Besides, while gypsies might steal something
on the outside, they very seldom have been
known to break into people&rsquo;s houses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I was afraid you would say that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might be worth following up as a clue if
we had nothing else to go on. But now we feel
pretty sure that Elsie Grant is guilty.... But
did this colored woman hear them last night&mdash;the
gypsies, I mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, she didn&rsquo;t. It was several nights ago, and
about the same time that William, the hired
man, reported that the chickens were gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What else did you learn this afternoon?&rdquo; inquired
her father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sounded this Mrs. Jones out about the necklace,
and she had never heard of any jewels at
Dark Cedars. I believe her&mdash;I don&rsquo;t think she
could have stolen that necklace&mdash;or her husband,
either.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">[214]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I never thought they did, for a minute. If
the thief had been a colored person, you would
have known it, I&rsquo;m sure. The hands alone are
different. Didn&rsquo;t you say that the hand that
touched you was thin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Almost bony. That&rsquo;s one reason why I
didn&rsquo;t suspect Elsie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how about Hannah? Did you learn her
whereabouts last night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Mary Louise, and she told of
the woman&rsquo;s visit, with her husband and sister,
to the moving-picture house&mdash;an alibi which the
girl could easily check up on tomorrow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hear Jane&rsquo;s whistle!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Gay.
&ldquo;The young people want you, dear. You better
go out with them and forget all this sad business
for the rest of the evening. I think you need
a little diversion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise thought so too, and dashed off
joyously to join her friends.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">[215]</div>
<h2 id="c17"><span class="small">CHAPTER XVII</span>
<br /><i>The Empty House</i></h2>
<p>Mr. Gay was seated at the telephone table in the
dining room the following morning when Mary
Louise came downstairs to breakfast. She waited
breathlessly for the news, for she felt sure that
he was talking to some of the police about the
whereabouts of Elsie Grant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s strange,&rdquo; she heard him say. &ldquo;I can
hardly believe it.... You checked up with the
bus companies as well as the railroads?...
O.K., then. Keep on searching,&rdquo; he concluded.</p>
<p>Replacing the receiver, he turned to his
daughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a trace of Elsie anywhere,&rdquo; he announced.</p>
<p>Mary Louise smiled: she was almost glad that
the girl had not been found. It gave her more
time to believe in Elsie&rsquo;s innocence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think she could have been kidnaped,
Daddy?&rdquo; she inquired. &ldquo;People are, pretty often,
nowadays.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">[216]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But they&rsquo;re always rich or important,&rdquo; returned
Mr. Gay. &ldquo;No: that&rsquo;s one of the blessings
of being poor&mdash;nobody would kidnap Elsie
Grant unless he knew that she had the ruby necklace.
Then the criminal would be much more
likely to steal it and let her go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I think,&rdquo; agreed Mary Louise....
&ldquo;What are you going to do now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing more I can do. I suppose
you are planning to go over to the hospital to
see Miss Grant?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, for a few minutes after breakfast. Then&mdash;Daddy&mdash;&rdquo;
Mary Louise hesitated: she didn&rsquo;t
want her father to laugh at her next request, but
she just had to ask him&mdash;&ldquo;would you be willing
to go on a search with me through Cooper&rsquo;s
woods? It&rsquo;s just possible that all our detective
work may be wrong and my unsuspecting mother
right. Elsie might be lost in Cooper&rsquo;s woods!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to smile,&rdquo; replied her father.
&ldquo;Because I think your suggestion is a very good
one. Elsie may even be guilty of the thefts&mdash;and
have the necklace and the gold pieces with her&mdash;and
still be lost or hiding in those woods. I&rsquo;ll
be glad to go with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise&rsquo;s brown eyes sparkled. What a
good sport her father was!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">[217]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s take the car, Daddy,&rdquo; she urged.
&ldquo;At least, not any farther than Dark Cedars. I&rsquo;d
like to set out from the back of Miss Grant&rsquo;s
yard and try to trace Elsie&rsquo;s steps&mdash;with Silky
to help us. If I get her old calico dress and shoes
and let him sniff them, I think he&rsquo;d understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Gay gazed at his daughter admiringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mary Lou, that is an idea!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
a better detective than I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She blushed at the praise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait till we see how my plan turns out,&rdquo; she
answered. &ldquo;It may lead to nothing at all....
Still, we&rsquo;ll be having fun. It&rsquo;ll be a regular hiking
trip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course it will be fun,&rdquo; agreed her father,
for he loved the out-of-doors. &ldquo;And we&rsquo;ll carry
blankets in case we stay overnight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this I hear?&rdquo; demanded Mrs. Gay,
appearing from the kitchen with the coffee pot
in her hands. &ldquo;What mischief are you two up
to now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only an all-day hike, my dear,&rdquo; explained
Mr. Gay calmly. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mind, do you? And
will you drive us as far as Dark Cedars and
bring the car back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Gay graciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I go?&rdquo; asked Freckles as he came into
the dining room with Silky at his heels.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">[218]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ll have to stay home and take
care of your mother, Son, for we may be gone
overnight,&rdquo; replied his father. &ldquo;But just wait
till I get my real vacation, later on. We&rsquo;ll have
a whale of a trip. All four of us together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you expect to be home in time for supper?&rdquo;
asked Mrs. Gay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That all depends upon our luck.&rdquo; And Mr.
Gay went on to explain to his wife the nature of
their excursion and the reason for making it.</p>
<p>While he assembled the necessary equipment
for the hike, Mary Louise hurried off to the hospital
to see Miss Grant. It was early, but she was
told that she might go up to the patient&rsquo;s room
immediately. The old lady was expecting her.</p>
<p>Mary Louise found her looking pale and
wasted, but her black eyes beamed as brightly as
ever, and she smiled faintly at her visitor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I brought you some flowers, Miss Grant,&rdquo;
began the girl cheerfully as she handed them to
the nurse. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m so glad to hear that you are
better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Grant nodded her thanks and indicated
that she wanted Mary Louise to sit down in the
chair beside her high white bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any news?&rdquo; she asked in a weak but eager
voice.</p>
<p>Mary Louise shook her head.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">[219]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing more,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;Mr. John
Grant told you about my awful experience on
Saturday night, didn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I was afraid something like that might
happen. I&rsquo;m sorry, Mary Louise, and thankful
that you weren&rsquo;t injured.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean you&rsquo;re sorrier for me than for
yourself&mdash;about losing the necklace?&rdquo; asked the
girl incredulously. This didn&rsquo;t sound at all like
the miser she believed Miss Grant to be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am. Because, somehow, I never
thought that necklace would do me any good. I
should have been afraid to sell it for fear it
would bring up some old scandal or some disgrace
about my father. I don&rsquo;t know how he got
hold of it&mdash;I was always afraid it had something
to do with gambling or a bet of some kind&mdash;but
I do know that my mother never approved of
his keeping it. And so I&rsquo;m almost thankful it&rsquo;s
gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who do you think could have taken it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Either the original owner&mdash;whoever he is&mdash;or
my mother&rsquo;s ghost. You read of queer things
like that sometimes, things that never can be
explained by the living. Perhaps when we are
dead we shall understand.... I don&rsquo;t know....
I dreamed about Mother night before last,
and in the dream I promised her to throw away
the necklace.... So I&rsquo;m almost thankful it&rsquo;s
gone.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">[220]</div>
<p>Mary Louise let out a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad it doesn&rsquo;t worry you, Miss Grant.
I was afraid you&rsquo;d suspect Elsie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sick woman&rsquo;s eyes flashed angrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do still suspect Elsie of taking my gold!&rdquo;
The old expression of greed crossed her face.
&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t found it for me yet, have you,
Mary Louise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I haven&rsquo;t, Miss Grant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is Elsie?&rdquo; was the next question.</p>
<p>Mary Louise hesitated: she hated to answer
this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is&mdash;lost. She went away yesterday&mdash;Sunday
morning&mdash;and hasn&rsquo;t come back yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Grant nodded significantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was expecting it. Well, you don&rsquo;t believe
any longer that she&rsquo;s innocent, do you, Mary
Louise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m still hoping,&rdquo; replied the girl.</p>
<p>Miss Grant was silent for some minutes, and
Mary Louise felt that it was time for her to go.
But before she made a move, she told the sick
woman of Hannah&rsquo;s decision to leave Dark
Cedars, and she held out the key.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">[221]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But I should like to keep it today, if you
don&rsquo;t mind, Miss Grant,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;so I can
get some clothing of Elsie&rsquo;s for Silky to sniff at.
I want to take him down to the woods to see
whether he can get on her trail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep it as long as you want it,&rdquo; agreed the
old lady. &ldquo;If Hannah is gone, I shan&rsquo;t return to
Dark Cedars very soon. John wants me to go to
his home, anyhow, when I get out of the hospital,
so I suppose I had better agree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you want to see William about your cow
and your garden?&rdquo; inquired Mary Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, tell him to stop in to see me here at the
hospital.... And now you had better go,
child.... I&rsquo;m very tired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Enormously relieved that the interview had
been so easy, Mary Louise left the hospital and
hurried back to her home. She met Jane Patterson
as she entered her own gate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What next?&rdquo; inquired her chum, who had
been told the previous evening of Elsie&rsquo;s disappearance.
&ldquo;Still acting the detective?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say,&rdquo; answered Mary Louise. &ldquo;Dad
and I are going off now in search of Elsie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you going? Harrisburg?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Cooper&rsquo;s woods. Want to come along,
Jane?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other girl shook her head.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">[222]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe so. I have a tennis date with
Norman, and Hope Dorsey is rounding up the
crowd to drive over to a country fair tonight.
She&rsquo;ll be furious if you don&rsquo;t go&mdash;and so will
Max. Kenneth was expecting we&rsquo;d bring Elsie
Grant along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only wish we could!&rdquo; sighed Mary Louise.
&ldquo;But maybe we shall be able to. Maybe we&rsquo;ll
find her and bring her back home in time for
supper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And maybe not,&rdquo; remarked Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to be off now,&rdquo; concluded the other,
giving her chum a hasty kiss. &ldquo;Wish me good
luck!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know I do!&rdquo; was the reply.</p>
<p>Mary Louise ran into the house and found
her father all ready to start. He had made up a
pack for each of them to carry; his own, the
heavier, included a small tent for use if they
were obliged to sleep in the woods. The food and
equipment were sufficient but not overabundant,
for Mr. Gay was a good camper and knew just
what was necessary and what could be left at
home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get into your knickers, Mary Lou,&rdquo; he advised.
&ldquo;And bring a sweater along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ll be cold?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The woods are chilly at night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring me back a bearskin,&rdquo; suggested
Freckles jokingly. &ldquo;I could use one.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">[223]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t expect to shoot anything,&rdquo; replied his
father. &ldquo;But, of course, you never can tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Half an hour later Mrs. Gay drove the two
adventurers over to Dark Cedars and let them
out at the hedge. Mary Louise, with Silky at her
heels, led the way up to the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a gloomy-looking place,&rdquo; observed her
father as he followed her through the trees. &ldquo;Yet
it could be made very attractive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise shuddered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody would ever want to live here after
all the ghost stories get around. You know how
people exaggerate, and the stories are bad
enough as they are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The porch certainly needs paint and repairs.
It&rsquo;s a wonder Miss Grant hasn&rsquo;t fallen down and
broken her neck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise inserted her key in the lock and
opened the heavy wooden door. Inside, the shutters
were carefully closed, and the dark, somber
house seemed almost like a tomb. The stairs
creaked ominously as the two ascended them, and
Mary Louise was thankful that she was not
alone. After that one experience in Miss Grant&rsquo;s
bedroom, she never knew what strange creature
might rush at her from the big, dark closet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can hardly see where I&rsquo;m going,&rdquo; remarked
Mr. Gay. &ldquo;You better take my hand, Mary
Lou.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">[224]</div>
<p>His daughter seized it gladly; she was only
too pleased to feel its human, reassuring pressure.
She led the way to the rear of the second
floor, up the attic steps to Elsie&rsquo;s room.</p>
<p>Here they found one of the windows open, so
that a subdued light brightened the attic room.
But there was no sunshine, for the boughs of the
cedar trees pressed against the window sill.</p>
<p>Silky had been following them at a respectful
distance, and Mary Louise lifted him up in her
arms as she opened the closet door. A musty
smell greeted her, but she had no difficulty in
finding the clothing she wanted, and she held it
close to Silky&rsquo;s nose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is Elsie&rsquo;s,&rdquo; she said, just as if the dog
were human. &ldquo;Elsie is lost, and you must find
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still keeping the dog in her arms and the
dress close to his nose, she carefully descended
the stairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to see Miss Grant&rsquo;s bedroom,&rdquo; said
Mr. Gay as they reached the second floor. &ldquo;I
want a look at the mattress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O.K., Daddy. But you go first. And have
your gun ready if you open that closet door. I
think that&rsquo;s where the ghosts live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mary Lou!&rdquo; cried her father in amazement.
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t believe that stuff, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">[225]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I did,&rdquo; sighed the girl. &ldquo;Because that
would make Elsie innocent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are very fond of Elsie, aren&rsquo;t you,
Daughter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She seemed so sweet. And all our crowd liked
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Gay went to the window of Miss Grant&rsquo;s
room and threw open the shutter to let in the
light. Just as Mary Louise had said, the mattress
was literally torn to pieces. Piles of straw were
heaped on the floor, and the ragged covering was
strewn all over the room.</p>
<p>Mr. Gay examined it, and Mary Louise
walked over to the side window&mdash;the one under
which William&rsquo;s ladder had been found.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even a piece from the mattress is on this
window ledge,&rdquo; she remarked as she pulled out
a long strip of material. She examined it more
closely. Suddenly her eyes blinked in excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t mattress cover, Daddy!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s clothing material! Blue sateen!
From&mdash;somebody&rsquo;s dress!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Gay reached the window in two quick
steps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you make of that, Mary Lou?&rdquo; he
demanded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">[226]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think it must be a piece from the thief&rsquo;s
clothing!&rdquo; she cried in delight. &ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t believe
it&rsquo;s Elsie&rsquo;s. Unless she was wearing some
old dress of her aunt&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; said Mr. Gay. &ldquo;Put the
strip into your pocket. Crimes have been solved
on slimmer evidence than that.&rdquo; He turned
aside. &ldquo;There are no ghosts in the closet, Mary
Lou,&rdquo; he announced solemnly. &ldquo;I just looked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then let&rsquo;s leave, Daddy. I&rsquo;m &lsquo;rarin&rsquo; to go&rsquo;&mdash;because&mdash;well&mdash;because
I have another reason
now besides wanting to find Elsie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You suspect somebody definitely?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. But don&rsquo;t ask me whom&mdash;yet. Just let&rsquo;s
go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still holding on to Elsie&rsquo;s calico dress, Mary
Louise led the way out of the house and around
to the back yard of Dark Cedars. Here they
found William complacently working in the
garden, as if nothing had ever happened to disturb
the peace at Miss Grant&rsquo;s home. He looked
up and smiled at Mary Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elsie didn&rsquo;t come back, did she, William?&rdquo;
asked the girl.</p>
<p>The old man shook his head. &ldquo;Nope,&rdquo; he replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any more chickens stolen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nope.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">[227]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;re off to hunt Elsie&mdash;my father and
I,&rdquo; explained Mary Louise. &ldquo;And, by the way,
William, Miss Grant wants you to stop in to see
her at the hospital.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do that,&rdquo; agreed the man. &ldquo;And good
luck to ye!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, William,&rdquo; returned Mary Louise.
&ldquo;Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She and her father walked on down the hill
towards the little shack where the colored family
lived, and stopped there to inquire again about
Elsie. But Mrs. Jones had not seen her since the
previous morning; however, she pointed out just
what path the girl had taken. So Mary Louise
put Silky on the trail, and the three began their
search.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">[228]</div>
<h2 id="c18"><span class="small">CHAPTER XVIII</span>
<br /><i>Found!</i></h2>
<p>With Silky in the lead, Mr. Gay and Mary
Louise followed the path behind Dark Cedars
which led directly into Cooper&rsquo;s woods. It was
new to them both, for although they had gone to
these woods many times, they had always entered
from the road that ran past the creek and the
swimming hole.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s much cooler this way,&rdquo; observed the girl.
&ldquo;So nice and shady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silky seems to know what he&rsquo;s doing,&rdquo; remarked
her father. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s going straight ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid he&rsquo;s making for the swimming
hole,&rdquo; returned Mary Louise. &ldquo;He loves a swim
as much as we do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you want to stop for one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to, but I don&rsquo;t think we better. It
would take too much time, dressing and undressing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe we can have one on our way
back.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">[229]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, maybe,&rdquo; agreed Mary Louise. &ldquo;I ought
to have brought Elsie&rsquo;s suit, so that if we find
her she could go with us. She loved it on Saturday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;re being a little too optimistic,
Daughter,&rdquo; replied Mr. Gay. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get
your hopes up too high.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The path grew wide again as they approached
the swimming hole, and when they arrived at
the stream Mary Louise took off her pack and
sat down under a tree. About a dozen children
were playing about in the water, and Mary Louise
threw a stick into the stream as a signal for
Silky to jump in. In another minute the children
were romping with him. Then they came out and
crowded around Mary Louise, admiring the
spaniel and asking his name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t see a girl about fifteen years old
in a green silk dress, did you, children?&rdquo; she inquired.</p>
<p>They shook their heads.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were any of you here yesterday morning?&rdquo;
asked Mr. Gay.</p>
<p>Two of the older boys replied that they had
been there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you see the girl then?&rdquo; persisted the
man.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">[230]</div>
<p>One boy thought that he did remember seeing
a young lady&mdash;&ldquo;all dressed up in a silk dress.&rdquo;
But she hadn&rsquo;t stopped at the pool; she had
crossed the bridge fifty yards below and had
taken the path right back into the deepest part
of the woods.</p>
<p>Mary Louise jumped to her feet.
&ldquo;Come on, Daddy! Let&rsquo;s get going!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about eating some of those sandwiches
your mother packed for us?&rdquo; suggested her
father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no&mdash;not yet!&rdquo; protested Mary Louise.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only eleven o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo; She turned to the
boys. &ldquo;Have you seen any gypsies around?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A couple of days ago,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;I
heard they moved on towards Coopersburg. A
fellow I know was over there last night and saw
them telling fortunes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the best way to Coopersburg?&rdquo; inquired
Mary Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Through the woods is shortest, I guess. But
I don&rsquo;t know if there&rsquo;s any path. We always go
around by the road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were going through the woods anyhow,&rdquo;
said Mary Louise. To her father she added, &ldquo;I
do want to see those gypsies again, almost as
much as I want to find Elsie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She whistled for Silky, and he came running
out of the water, shaking himself joyously and
rolling over and over on the grass.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">[231]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s forgotten all about the trail he&rsquo;s supposed
to be following,&rdquo; remarked Mary Louise,
producing the purple calico dress. &ldquo;Come here,
Silky, and sniff this again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The couple turned their steps to the bridge
and soon were out of the open space, back in the
cool shade of the woods. Here the path was narrow
and deeply shaded, so that they had to walk
single file for a long distance, sometimes picking
their way carefully among the thick undergrowth.
About noon they stopped to eat the
sandwiches which Mrs. Gay had packed and to
drink the iced-tea from the thermos bottle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s still a long walk to Coopersburg,&rdquo; sighed
Mary Louise. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d forgotten how these woods
wound around. I don&rsquo;t believe I ever walked this
way before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you tired?&rdquo; inquired her father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little. But mostly hot. I&rsquo;ll soon cool off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t try to walk back,&rdquo; replied Mr.
Gay. &ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t find Elsie, we can take a bus
back from Coopersburg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we should do that, Daddy,&rdquo;
argued Mary Louise. &ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t find her or
the gypsies either, I think we should come back
here and camp for the night. That would give
us a chance to make a more thorough search of
the woods tomorrow. Because we might easily
miss Elsie just by keeping on this path, as we
are doing now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">[232]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you want to find the gypsies, Mary
Lou?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They may have seen Elsie. For fifty cents
that fortune teller will give you any information
you want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Gay smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid she&rsquo;d make up anything she didn&rsquo;t
know,&rdquo; he remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, she was right about Jane&rsquo;s lost ring&mdash;and
about the ruby necklace,&rdquo; Mary Louise reminded
him. &ldquo;John Grant said so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but she used her common sense in the
first case, and in the second, she may have heard
a rumor about the necklace&mdash;especially if this
particular band of gypsies has been coming to
this neighborhood for years.... I wouldn&rsquo;t
attach too much faith to these people, Daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They gathered up the remains of their picnic
lunch and started forward again, with Silky in
the lead. On and on they walked for several
hours, talking very little, and stopping only now
and then for a drink of water from a spring or
two which they passed. About three o&rsquo;clock they
came to a widening of the path, and through the
trees they could see the fields that surrounded
the town of Coopersburg.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">[233]</div>
<p>With a new burst of energy Mary Louise
started to run forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see some tents, Daddy!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;And
that caravan! Oh, I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s the gypsies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t run, Mary Lou!&rdquo; called her father.
&ldquo;With that heavy pack on your back! I&rsquo;m afraid
you&rsquo;ll hurt yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t wait, Daddy.&rdquo; But she stopped and
turned around, removing the pack from her
shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You keep the packs, Daddy,&rdquo; she said when
he had caught up to her, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll go ahead. I&rsquo;d
rather see the fortune teller by myself, anyhow.
But stay where I can see you&mdash;within calling
distance. And if I don&rsquo;t come back in half an
hour, come and look for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mary Lou, are you expecting any trouble
from these gypsies?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You never can tell!&rdquo; she laughingly replied.
Blowing him a kiss with her hand, she started
to run towards the encampment. When she was
about fifty yards away she saw the same children
whom she had noticed the day of the picnic, and
she looked eagerly for the fortune teller. A few
yards farther on she recognized the woman,
coming from one of the tents.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">[234]</div>
<p>It seemed to Mary Louise that an expression
of terror crossed the gypsy&rsquo;s face as the woman
caught sight of her. But only for a second; in a
moment she was grinning and showing all the
gaps in her front teeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fortune?&rdquo; she asked immediately, as Mary
Louise approached her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;that is&mdash;not exactly,&rdquo; replied the girl.
However, she held up a silver half dollar in her
hand, and the gypsy turned and lifted the flap
of the tent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring the cards out here,&rdquo; suggested Mary
Louise, glancing back towards the woods to
make sure that her father was within sight. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
too hot to go inside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman nodded and took the dirty pack
of cards out of the pocket of her dress.
&ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; she commanded, and Mary Louise
did as she was told.</p>
<p>The oddly assorted pair stared at each other
for a moment in silence. Mary Louise&rsquo;s eyes
traveled slowly about the gypsy woman, from
the top of her black head to the tips of her big
old shoes. She examined her dress&mdash;of the same
deep-blue color which she was wearing the day
of the picnic&mdash;and she looked at her thin, bony,
yet strong hands.... Then, very deliberately,
Mary Louise reached into the pocket of her
knickers and brought out the strip of blue sateen
which she had taken from the window ledge in
Miss Mattie Grant&rsquo;s bedroom at Dark Cedars.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">[235]</div>
<p>With a triumphant gleam in her eyes, she held
the piece of torn material close to the gypsy&rsquo;s
dress. Dirty and spotted as it was, there could be
no doubt of its identity. It was a perfect match!</p>
<p>A wild gasp of terror escaped from the gypsy&rsquo;s
lips, and she made a grab at the condemning
piece of evidence. But Mary Louise was too
quick for her. Springing to her feet, she leaned
over and hit the woman right in the mouth with
her clenched fist. The gypsy groaned and rolled
over in the grass.</p>
<p>Amazed at her own action, Mary Louise stood
gazing at the woman in calm triumph. It had
been years since she had hit anyone; she was surprised
that she had it in her to deal such a blow.
But the gypsy was not knocked out&mdash;merely
stunned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is Miss Grant&rsquo;s necklace?&rdquo; she demanded.</p>
<p>The woman opened her eyes and whimpered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It don&rsquo;t belong to that old witch! It&rsquo;s mine,
I tell you! Was my mother&rsquo;s, and her mother&rsquo;s
before that. Old woman Grant had no right to
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She raised herself to a sitting position, and her
black eyes flashed with hatred. &ldquo;You wait till
my man comes back&mdash;and see what he&rsquo;ll do to
you!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">[236]</div>
<p>Mary Louise smiled confidently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t intend to wait,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;I have
a member of the police force right here with
me.&rdquo; She raised her voice and cupped her hands.
&ldquo;Daddy, come!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A look of awful fright crossed the gypsy&rsquo;s
wrinkled face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! No! Don&rsquo;t put me in jail! I&rsquo;ll give you
the necklace. But it&rsquo;s mine&mdash;it&rsquo;s mine by right, I
tell you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise was scarcely listening, so eagerly
was she watching her father&rsquo;s quick approach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can tell that to Detective Gay,&rdquo; she said
finally. &ldquo;And, by the way, where is the box of
gold pieces you stole from Miss Grant?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gold pieces? What? Uh&mdash;I never took&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
But her tone was not convincing, and seeing that
Mary Louise did not believe her, she suddenly
changed her story. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you the gold pieces
if you let me keep my mother&rsquo;s necklace,&rdquo; she
pleaded.</p>
<p>Mr. Gay reached his daughter&rsquo;s side in time
to overhear this last statement. His eyes were
shining at his daughter in speechless admiration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your badge, please, Daddy,&rdquo; said Mary
Louise calmly. &ldquo;Please show it to this woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Gay did as he was requested.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">[237]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now go and get the necklace and the gold,&rdquo;
Mary Louise commanded the gypsy.</p>
<p>The woman struggled to her feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First let me tell you about that necklace!&rdquo;
she begged. Her bony hands clutched Mary
Louise&rsquo;s sleeve, and she looked imploringly into
the girl&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;It was a precious heirloom&mdash;has
been in our family for years and years. We held
it sacred; it brought us good luck. Oh, I can&rsquo;t
bear to give it up now that I&rsquo;ve got it again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise glanced questioningly at her
father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down again,&rdquo; he said to the gypsy, &ldquo;and
tell us the story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, sir!&rdquo; exclaimed the woman,
dropping down on the grass at his feet. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell
you....</p>
<p>&ldquo;It goes back fifty years,&rdquo; she began, talking
rapidly, &ldquo;in my mother&rsquo;s time, when we used
to come here to Cooper&rsquo;s woods to camp every
summer.... I was a child&mdash;and so was my
little brother. A little fellow of six&mdash;my mother&rsquo;s
darling....</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">[238]</div>
<p>&ldquo;One day he got suddenly sick. A terrible
pain in his side. My mother almost went crazy,
for she felt sure he was going to die. We couldn&rsquo;t
do a thing for him; the pain got worse and worse
and worse. Then, like a burst of sunshine after a
storm, Mr. Grant came riding up to us&mdash;and
stopped and asked what was the matter. I can
remember just how he looked&mdash;not a bit like his
awful daughter Mattie! He promised to help us,
to take my little brother to the hospital and get
him well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mother agreed, and she went off with
Mr. Grant and the boy. They told her there at
the hospital that the child had appendicitis, and
Mr. Grant ordered the best doctor in the country....
And my brother got well!</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mother was so happy that we thought
she&rsquo;d dance forever. She wanted to pay Mr.
Grant for the expense, but he was such a generous
man he wouldn&rsquo;t hear of it. So my mother
gave him the ruby necklace to keep for her and
said she&rsquo;d be back every summer to see it. If ever
Mr. Grant needed money, he was to borrow on
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He promised to keep it safe for her, but he
never thought of it as his. Each summer we
came back and camped on his place&mdash;we were
always welcome while he lived&mdash;and each year
we saw the necklace, and he would ask us
whether we wanted to take it back. But we said
no, because it was safer there, and he was our
friend, and we trusted him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">[239]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And then one summer we came back, and old
Mr. Grant was gone. Dead. So we tried to tell
Miss Mattie Grant about the necklace, but she
shut the door in our faces and called the police.
For years we couldn&rsquo;t even come out of Cooper&rsquo;s
woods without meeting a policeman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then my mother died, and my brother died,
and I decided I was going to get that necklace
back. So this year we came and camped in those
woods, and every night I went over to Dark
Cedars. Sometimes I&rsquo;d sneak in while they were
eating supper; sometimes I&rsquo;d climb in a window
with a ladder late at night. I began in the attic
and went through each room, searching for the
necklace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first time I got into Mattie Grant&rsquo;s room&mdash;it
was one evening last week, while they were
eating supper&mdash;I opened that safe of hers. I was
sure the necklace would be there. But it wasn&rsquo;t.
I was so mad that I took that box of gold, although
I hadn&rsquo;t stolen anything out of her house
before that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the woman paused for breath, Mary
Louise recalled the evening of the theft of Miss
Grant&rsquo;s money. This, then, was the explanation
of the open safe, from which Corinne Pearson
had taken the bills. And it proved, too, that
Harry Grant had been innocent of any part in
the actual theft.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">[240]</div>
<p>The gypsy woman continued her story:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was you, miss, who gave me the information
I wanted, the day you girls and boys had
your fortunes told. You told me old Mattie
asked you to sleep in her bed while she was
away. So I knew that the necklace must be hidden
in the mattress....</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know the rest. I went to Dark Cedars
while you were still at your picnic, and I
thought I&rsquo;d get the necklace before you came
home. But you surprised me, and I had to hide
in the closet while you got ready for bed....
I&mdash;I&mdash;didn&rsquo;t want to hurt you! I only wanted
what belonged to me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tears were running out of the woman&rsquo;s eyes,
and she rubbed her hands together in anguish,
as if she were imploring Mary Louise for mercy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you say, Mary Lou?&rdquo; asked her
father.</p>
<p>Mary Louise hesitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;honestly believe she has more right to
that necklace than Miss Grant has,&rdquo; she answered
finally. &ldquo;So, if she will turn over the box
of gold, I&rsquo;m for letting her keep the necklace....
But what do you think, Daddy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s your case, dear. You are to decide.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">[241]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose you go with her, Daddy, while she
gets both things. And be sure to keep your revolver
handy, too,&rdquo; she added shrewdly.</p>
<p>Mr. Gay smiled: he was delighted with his
daughter&rsquo;s keenness.</p>
<p>The gypsy nodded and, stepping inside her
tent, produced the box of gold. The identical tin
box which Elsie had mentioned. The necklace
she took from a pocket in her petticoat. Meekly
she handed both treasures to Mr. Gay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How beautiful that necklace is!&rdquo; cried Mary
Louise, in admiration of the sparkling jewels. It
was the first time in her life that she had ever
seen real rubies, and their radiance, their brilliance,
was breath-taking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love them dearly,&rdquo; said the gypsy, in a
hoarse tone, filled with emotion.</p>
<p>Mary Louise took the necklace from her
father and handed it back to its real owner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may have it,&rdquo; she said slowly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take
the gold back to Miss Grant. But first I must
count it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all there,&rdquo; mumbled the woman, her
hands fondling the beloved rubies.</p>
<p>Mary Louise found her statement to be correct,
and, handing the box back to her father,
she turned to go.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">[242]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I almost forgot!&rdquo; she exclaimed, glancing
at the gypsy. &ldquo;Have you seen a young girl
anywhere around here&mdash;or in the woods?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before the woman could answer, Silky, who
had run straight to the motor truck, began to
bark loudly and incessantly. Putting his front
feet on the step, he peered eagerly into the caravan,
and increased his noise until it reached a
volume of which a police dog might have been
proud. Nor did he stop until a head showed
itself from the door and a voice called him by
name.</p>
<p>Mary Louise, watching the little drama, suddenly
cried out in joy.</p>
<p>The girl coming from the caravan was none
other than Elsie Grant!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">[243]</div>
<h2 id="c19"><span class="small">CHAPTER XIX</span>
<br /><i>Conclusion</i></h2>
<p>Mary Louise threw her arms around Elsie and
hugged her tightly. It was so good to know that
she was innocent&mdash;and safe!</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve found the gold pieces!&rdquo; exclaimed
the girl, staring at the box in Mr. Gay&rsquo;s hand.
&ldquo;And the necklace!&rdquo; she added, as the gypsy
proudly put on the jewels and went off to show
her people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll tell you all about it later,&rdquo; replied
Mary Louise. &ldquo;But first I want to hear about
you, Elsie: why you are here, and how these
gypsies have been treating you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve been treating me splendidly! Much
better than Aunt Mattie ever did. You see, they
liked my father and my grandfather, and they
hated Aunt Mattie. So of course they have a lot
of sympathy for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But when did you come to them?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">[244]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yesterday afternoon. I was perfectly miserable
after Saturday night. I knew Jane suspected
me of doing that terrible thing to you, and I
never slept a wink the whole night. So I decided
to run away. I didn&rsquo;t think of the gypsies at the
time: I just wanted to get out of Riverside. I
put on the green silk dress you gave me, and
tied up my other things in a bundle, and made
off through the woods so that I wouldn&rsquo;t meet
anybody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Jones saw you go,&rdquo; said Mary Louise.
&ldquo;It was she who put Daddy and Silky and me on
the trail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I took some fruit and some biscuits from the
kitchen at Dark Cedars,&rdquo; Elsie went on to explain.
&ldquo;I thought I&rsquo;d walk to the nearest town
and ask for work. Now that I have some decent
clothes, I don&rsquo;t feel ashamed to be seen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you came upon the gypsies before you
got to any town?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Gay, who
couldn&rsquo;t keep out of the conversation, although
he had not been properly introduced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. And I was tired and hungry, so I
thought maybe they&rsquo;d let me stay overnight with
them. They were stewing chicken, and it smelled
so good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your aunt Mattie&rsquo;s chickens,&rdquo; explained
Mary Louise laughingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; asked Elsie in surprise. The idea
had not occurred to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Mrs. Jones saw the gypsies stealing the
chickens.... Well, did they give you some
supper?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">[245]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They certainly did. Mira&mdash;she is the fortune
teller&mdash;let me sleep in her tent. She said she used
to play with my father when he was a little boy,
when my grandfather&mdash;old Mr. Grant, you recall&mdash;let
the gypsies camp at Dark Cedars. She
told me I could stay with them all my life if I
wanted to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t expect to do it, did you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wanted to get a job. But there isn&rsquo;t much I
can do, I&rsquo;m afraid.&rdquo; The young girl&rsquo;s voice grew
sad; the future looked gray to her.</p>
<p>Mary Louise took her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re coming right back to Riverside with
Daddy and me,&rdquo; she announced. &ldquo;Your aunt
Mattie will have to promise to treat you better,
or else she won&rsquo;t get her gold pieces back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be furious about the necklace,&rdquo; said
Elsie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, she won&rsquo;t either. I happen to know that
she&rsquo;ll be thankful to have the matter all cleared
up. And she&rsquo;ll be delighted to get the money,
because that is rightfully hers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Gay leaned over and picked up his pack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You go get your things together, Elsie,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;and say good-bye to your gypsy friends.
We&rsquo;ll take a bus back to Riverside from Coopersburg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You really want me?&rdquo; asked the girl.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">[246]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Absolutely!&rdquo; replied Mary Louise. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
going to go to high school this fall, I hope, and
belong to our crowd of young people. All the
boys and girls like you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elsie&rsquo;s face lighted up with a happy smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I like them, too&mdash;but you and Jane will
always come first. Oh, I&rsquo;m so glad that Jane
will believe in me again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ten minutes later the two girls and Mr. Gay
were seated in the bus bound for Riverside.
Mary Louise held Silky in her arms under her
pack when she got in, and the conductor did not
even notice him. She was thankful for that, because
she was much too tired to walk.</p>
<p>They went straight to the Gays&rsquo; home, taking
Elsie with them. Mrs. Gay was sitting on the
front porch, little thinking that her two adventurers
would return so soon. She jumped up in
delight when she saw them coming in at the
gate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And is this Elsie?&rdquo; she asked as the three
tired wanderers ascended the porch steps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mother, this is Elsie Grant,&rdquo; replied
Mary Louise. &ldquo;We found her, and we caught the
thief too. It was the gypsy fortune teller.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, of all things!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Gay.
&ldquo;And had she kidnaped Elsie too?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_247">[247]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no, Elsie went there voluntarily, because
everybody suspected her of the crime, and she
was unhappy. But Elsie had no idea the gypsy
was the thief, until she heard us accusing her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I&rsquo;d only have been a detective like Mary
Louise,&rdquo; the girl remarked admiringly, &ldquo;I might
have guessed. But I&rsquo;m pretty stupid about things
like that. I even ate some of Aunt Mattie&rsquo;s
chicken for my supper last night without ever
guessing that the gypsies stole it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Gay laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it certainly is nice to have you all back
again. We&rsquo;ll have a fine dinner to celebrate&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
send Freckles for ice cream when he comes in.&rdquo;
She stooped over and patted the little dog&rsquo;s head.
&ldquo;Silky shall have some too. He loves ice cream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise took Elsie up to her room, and
the two girls lay down on the bed to rest after
they had removed their dusty clothing and
cooled themselves under the shower. At five
o&rsquo;clock Mrs. Gay came in with the news that
Jane Patterson was downstairs, asking for her
chum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please tell her to come up, Mother,&rdquo; replied
Mary Louise. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand why she is
being so formal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She knows Elsie is here,&rdquo; explained Mrs.
Gay, &ldquo;and thought you might not like to be disturbed.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_248">[248]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Does she know I didn&rsquo;t steal the money or
the necklace?&rdquo; demanded Elsie eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mary Louise&rsquo;s father is telling her the story
now. Freckles just came in, and he had to hear
all about it too. He&rsquo;s almost as keen to become a
detective as Mary Louise is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Gay returned to the first floor, and in a
couple of minutes Jane Patterson dashed into
the bedroom. She hugged both Elsie and Mary
Louise at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a wonder, Mary Lou!&rdquo; she cried.
&ldquo;Sherlock Holmes, and Philo Vance, and Spencer
Dean haven&rsquo;t a thing on you for solving
mysteries. Why, I bet your father loses his job
and they hire you in his place!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Jane, be rational!&rdquo; begged Mary
Louise.</p>
<p>The visitor seated herself upon the edge of
the bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, I&rsquo;ll try.... What I came over
about was to see whether you and Elsie can go
with our crowd to that country fair tonight.
We&rsquo;re leaving early after supper, and Mother
and Dad are both going along. You can take
Freckles too&mdash;but not Silky. He might get into
a fight with the cows or pigs or something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t insult my dog!&rdquo; returned Mary Louise
solemnly. &ldquo;Silky never associates with pigs!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_249">[249]</div>
<p>&ldquo;O.K.... Well, can you go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d love to, but don&rsquo;t you think we ought
to take Miss Grant&rsquo;s money back to her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not tonight, certainly!&rdquo; was Jane&rsquo;s emphatic
reply. &ldquo;Let her worry about it a little longer&mdash;it&rsquo;s
good for her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But shouldn&rsquo;t I go over to see her?&rdquo; asked
Elsie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tomorrow&rsquo;s time enough for that,&rdquo; answered
Mary Louise. &ldquo;You can stay all night with me
tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Gay heartily approved of the plan, for
she felt that both her daughter and Elsie needed
a little diversion, and so for the time being the
adventure at Dark Cedars was completely forgotten.
Early after supper the young people
drove off in four cars and enjoyed themselves
thoroughly until nearly midnight.</p>
<p>But both Elsie and Mary Louise awakened
early the following morning, intent upon tying
up the few remaining threads of the mystery at
Dark Cedars.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_250">[250]</div>
<p>Mary Louise had been hoping, ever since she
found Elsie, that the girl would be invited to
live at the home of Mrs. Grace Grant&mdash;if her
aunt Mattie would agree to contribute something
towards her support. With this plan in her
mind, she turned Elsie over to Jane to entertain
for the morning, and she herself went directly
to the Grants&rsquo; home in Riverside. She was fortunate
in catching John Grant before he left for
business, for she believed him to be an ally.</p>
<p>He and his mother were seated at the breakfast
table when she arrived. The maid brought
her right into the dining room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-morning, Mrs. Grant&mdash;and Mr.
Grant,&rdquo; she began brightly. &ldquo;I must apologize
for this early call, but I have great news. We
caught the thief!&rdquo;</p>
<p>John Grant, who had risen at Mary Louise&rsquo;s
entrance, stepped forward excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not really?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;Do you mean
Elsie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Mr. Grant, Elsie is not a thief. It was
the gypsy fortune teller.&rdquo; And Mary Louise
went on to explain the story of the necklace as
the woman had told it to her. She concluded
with the finding of Elsie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The poor child has been perfectly miserable
all the time she lived with her aunt Mattie,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;So I wondered&mdash;if I can make Miss Grant
pay something towards her support&mdash;whether
she couldn&rsquo;t live here. She needs someone like
you, Mrs. Grant, to be a mother to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old lady&rsquo;s kind heart was touched.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_251">[251]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course she can live here!&rdquo; she exclaimed,
&ldquo;whether Mattie contributes towards her support
or not. We&rsquo;ll manage somehow. Don&rsquo;t you
think we can, John?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have thought so all along,&rdquo; replied her son.
&ldquo;Elsie should go to high school, like other normal
young girls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise seized the hands of both people
at once. She was wild with joy at the success of
her plan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going straight to the hospital now,&rdquo; she
said, picking up the heavy tin box which she had
laid on a small table in the dining room, &ldquo;to see
what kind of bargain I can drive with Miss
Grant!&rdquo;</p>
<p>John laughed. &ldquo;You have the gold?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. But I&rsquo;m not going to give it to her till
she makes me some sort of promise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me drive you over,&rdquo; he suggested. &ldquo;That
box must be heavy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has five hundred dollars in gold in it,&rdquo; returned
Mary Louise. &ldquo;I counted it, to make sure.
Probably Miss Grant will offer me ten dollars
as a reward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can believe that,&rdquo; agreed Mrs. Grant. &ldquo;She
certainly is stingy. Poor little Elsie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Five minutes later John Grant left Mary
Louise at the entrance to the hospital, and the
girl carried her heavy box up to the patient&rsquo;s
room. But it was carefully wrapped and tied, so
that Miss Grant had no idea what it contained.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_252">[252]</div>
<p>The old lady was looking much brighter this
morning. She smiled pleasantly as her young
friend entered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mary Louise!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Any news?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lots of news,&rdquo; replied the girl, seating herself
in the chair beside the bed. &ldquo;Do you feel
equal to hearing it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly do. Have you found my money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to tell you the story straight from the
beginning. But before I do that, I want to assure
you that Elsie is innocent. We found the real
thief, and we also found Elsie. She ran away
because she was unhappy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Grant&rsquo;s eyes sparkled with eagerness.
&ldquo;Never mind about Elsie now. Tell me who stole
my money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the gypsies,&rdquo; replied Mary Louise. &ldquo;I
can give it to you if you&rsquo;ll promise to donate
some of it for Elsie&rsquo;s support. Mrs. Grace Grant
wants her to live with them, but you know how
poor she is now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, all right, I&rsquo;ll give you fifty dollars
if you get it all back for me! Where is it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_253">[253]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you in a minute.&rdquo; Mary Louise
couldn&rsquo;t help enjoying teasing the miserly
woman in retaliation for the way she had treated
Elsie. &ldquo;But it isn&rsquo;t a case of giving fifty dollars
now. It&rsquo;s rather that you pay Mrs. Grant something&mdash;say
twenty dollars a month&mdash;as your
share towards Elsie&rsquo;s support.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Grant groaned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For how long?&rdquo; she demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Till Elsie finishes high school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a lot of money.... Still, I wouldn&rsquo;t
have to have the child around. And she does
irritate me.... Yes, I&rsquo;ll agree. Where is my
money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise unwrapped her box and put it
down upon the white bed. Miss Grant reached
for it as a child might grab at his Christmas
stocking. She opened it and immediately began
to count the gold pieces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all here!&rdquo; she cried exultantly.</p>
<p>Mary Louise nodded. &ldquo;Shall I tell you the
story now&mdash;about the necklace?&rdquo; she inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes. I had forgotten the necklace. Where
is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you won&rsquo;t get that, Miss Grant,
because it never really belonged to your father.&rdquo;
And Mary Louise went on to relate the gypsy&rsquo;s
story.</p>
<p>Still fingering the gold, the old lady listened
intently.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_254">[254]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that sounds right to me,&rdquo; she agreed, as
the story ended. &ldquo;I am thankful that the necklace
is back with its rightful owner. That would
please my mother. Maybe now Dark Cedars will
be a more peaceful place to live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe it will be,&rdquo; concluded Mary Louise
as she rose to go. &ldquo;Here is your key, Miss Grant&mdash;and&mdash;good-bye!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait, Mary Louise! I want to give you forty
dollars&mdash;in gold. You can give ten to Jane, as I
promised her, but I think you deserve thirty.
You&rsquo;re a good, clever girl!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, thank you, Miss Grant. What I did, I
did because of my love and sympathy for Elsie.
If you will treat her fairly, that is all the reward
I want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old lady gazed at the girl in amazement
at her refusal. But she saw that she meant what
she said; perhaps Mary Louise&rsquo;s generosity put
her to shame.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will, Mary Louise,&rdquo; she promised solemnly.
&ldquo;I will indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, well satisfied with the happy solution of
the mystery at Dark Cedars, Mary Louise hurried
back to tell Elsie Grant the good news
about her new home and the four happy years at
high school which were in store for her.</p>
